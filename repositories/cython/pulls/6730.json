IIUC, the code says that we do not optimise method calls that pass `**kwds` (`not kwds_is_dict_node`), as the comment says, or doesn't pass keywords at all, which seems to contradict the `f(a=1, b=2)` part on first and maybe second read. Mentioning both cases would make it easier to understand.\r\n\r\nI think the general issue is that `kwds_is_dict_node` isn't a clear name of the parameter. By the name, it can intuitively suggest the `**kwargs` case (that's passing a dict, right?), whereas it really means the opposite, the spelled our keywords case. I'll refactor that part.",
