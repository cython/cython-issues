    "body": "Python semantics dictate that we first try the mapping protocol and then the sequence protocol for subscripting. When the index is a C integer, we can optimise perfectly for list/tuple, but all other sequences suffer from having to build a Python `int` object for the index to pass it through the mapping lookup if they implement that (e.g. to support extended slicing, like NumPy arrays).\r\n\r\nPython 3.10 added type markers (for pattern matching) for explicitly declaring a type as sequence or mapping, called `Py_TPFLAGS_SEQUENCE` and `Py_TPFLAGS_MAPPING`, which can now be checked for quite quickly. If a type is marked as sequence but still implements mapping lookups for slicing, and it supports sequence subscripting, we can avoid the Python `int` creation of the mapping protocol and go straight through the sequence index lookup.\r\n\r\nWith this change, indexing into Python's `array.array` and `memoryview` types is ~60% faster in a micro-benchmark.\r\nUsing a C integer as dict key got slightly slower but is resolved by adding a separate up-front special case.\r\n\r\nBenchmark is based on https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/7431\r\n\r\nSee\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_SEQUENCE\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1807\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/55915\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/55179#issuecomment-1802484187",
