I don't know the Cython codebase well enough to try to do that. \r\n\r\n- Test suite?\r\n-- I'm not sure how to implement this, or if it'd even make sense to do so, for an issue that's only an enhancement of existing behaviour. \r\n--- Run a fused `cpdef` and a static `cpdef`, and compare that their execution times are within a specific factor? Compile and run fused `cpdef`s with different numbers of unique types, and check that their execution times don't look like they're growing exponentially/quadratically? All the potential tests seem like they'd be somewhat arbitrary and unreliable.\r\n\r\n- Organization, coding style, etc.\r\n-- This is not just my first attempt at contributing to Cython, but also my first attempt at contributing code to any open source project, or any group project, at all. I tried to use approximately the same conventions that were in the existing code, so just let me know if there's anything that I can fix.",
