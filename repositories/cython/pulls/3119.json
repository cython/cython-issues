    "body": "This hopefully \"finishes\" the support for unicode identifiers. It builds off https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3096, so I don't think there's much point in looking at it before that's finalized.\r\n\r\nIt adds 2 features:\r\n1. Support for unicode identifiers in C/C++ features such as structs and cppclasses. For structs used purely in Python I've mangled the names with punycode. For features that are exported/imported to C with \"public\" or \"extern\", I've translated the names to be \\uXXXX escaped (without any mangling or normalization). Pretty much every modern C/C++ compiler supports unicode in identifiers in this form (only Clang supports it in raw form I think), so this this seems like the most compatible thing to do. I've trusted that the user knows what names they want and not performed any normalization for these (I don't think normalization is yet defined in C/C++ standards, so it's hard to do anything else).\r\n\r\n2. Support for import of modules with unicode in their names. As in PEP 489 this is only supported from Python 3.5 onwards (but the Cython translation step should work fine in earlier versions...). The Python 2 filename handling in Cython.Build seems a bit fragile with unicode filenames (since most os.path functions require bytes) - I haven't made any serious attempt to fix that beyond getting my test-cases to work.",
