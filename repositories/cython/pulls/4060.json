As long as I was there I turned the PEP and github issue mentions into links. I can revert this if it seems too much.\r\n\r\nThere are many warnings when building docs.  I quieted some of the easiest ones:\r\n- added the index for docs/reference and the contributing page to the front index to make them more prominent and quiet some warnings about \"page not included in TOC\"\r\n- added `:orphan:` to some pages that are used as historical reference to quiet warnings about \"page not included in TOC\".\r\n\r\nFixing others warnings is more invasive so will need another PR",
