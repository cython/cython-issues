This includes https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3961 by necessity (so will look a bit smaller if that is merged ahead of this PR)\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n1. Relax some restriction on cdef class staticmethods/classmethods\r\n\r\n    Where it isn't able to do the efficient thing it falls back to calling the builtin method staticmethod/classmethod.\r\n\r\n    staticmethod/classmethod are only special-cased when the decorator is innermost.     Fixes https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1434\r\n\r\n2. Fixes https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1274\r\n\r\n    Where a method is arbitrarily decorated we don't really know the type of the `self` argument - it's probably just the type of the `cdef class`, but it could be anything else. Therefore we produce a warning with the suggestion to type the self argument appropriately. This is hopefully fairly intuitive, preserves speed for the common case while allowing the less common case to be supported.\r\n\r\n    Additionally adds a compiler option `fused_types_arbitrary_decorators`. With this enabled we produce a fused function with the `self` type either that of the `cdef class`, or `object`. This option supports both cases automatically but is off by default (since it's potentially an unexpected change). This would be mostly transparent to the user, but if they look hard they will be able to tell it's a `fused` function, mostly because the function has `__getitem__` defined.\r\n\r\n    I suspect it fixes\r\n    https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3072\r\n    https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3044\r\n    but the associated test-cases were large and fairly confusing",
