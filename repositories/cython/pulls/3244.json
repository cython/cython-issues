            "body": "@scoder  I totally understand your concern, but I don't see other solution which doesn't include the list of types. However, I don't feel like this solution is fragile as they are very special types. I'll try to explain my logic:\r\n1. This branch is used for declaring a variable without any initializations i.e. `a = declare(cython.int)`\r\n2. The result variable becomes uninitialized in case of simple types like `int` from C compiler perspective and it looks reasonable if it becomes `None` when interpreted\r\n3. In the case of the classes, the value `None` matches the generated C code\r\n4. The hardest case is structs, unions, and arrays. They are allocated on the stack in C and we cannot just return `None`. In such cases, we actually return the instance of the type witch exactly matches C code. That's why we need this check against the list of types \r\n5. The last case is the typedef. It is handled on the basis of the `base_type` (in the new commit which has been just added)\r\n\r\nI've added more tests to verify everything. Please take a look and let me know what do you think. I'm totally flexible to change the implementation as long as all the new tests pass.\r\n",

To fix that I got rid of this check completely and replaced it to exact checks which also simplified the code\n* Changed `declare` implementation when initializing arguments are not provided. Now it correctly works with typedefs of the user classes and also directly support arrays:\n    ```\n    >>> EmptyClassSyn = cython.typedef(EmptyClass)\n    >>> cython.declare(EmptyClassSyn) is None\n    True\n    >>> cython.declare(cython.int[2]) is not None\n    True\n    ```\n* Added missed return statement to `index_type` which made the following assigment possible:\n    ```\n        a = cython.declare(cython.int[2])\n        a[0] = 1\n    ```",
