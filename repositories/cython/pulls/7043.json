They can be enabled in\n-the module `Cython.Compiler.DebugFlags <https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Compiler/DebugFlags.py>`_.\n-Read the comments in that file, enable the relevant debug features\n-(usually ``debug_trace_code_generation`` to get started), and then read\n-the C code that Cython generates to find out what is going on.\n+One simple and useful feature to help you start: by default Cython injects the source\n+Python code into the C code as comments in the form:\n+\n+.. code-block:: c\n \n-One trick to identify the origin of *a specific line* of C code is\n-to use the Python debugger to stop when that specific line is written by adding\n-``if s.find(\"your line of code\") != -1: import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`` to the\n-`CCodeWriter.write function in Code.py <https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/b9cecd602878334173aa9f6ed635d48739bfa2b1/Cython/Compiler/Code.py#L1820>`_.\n+    /* \"source_file.pyx\":2\n+     * def print_hello():\n+     *    print(\"Hello world\")       # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n+     */\n+    \n+    __pyx_t_1 = /* some complicated C expression */;\n \n-It's usually best to write a test case for the code you want to debug. See the next section on how to do this.\n+so searching the generated C code file for the line of Python/Cython code you're interested in can be\n+a good place to start.  Some lines may appear in more than one place.
