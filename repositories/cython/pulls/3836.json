It exists for the duration of the function only.\n+      \n+   Typed memoryview\n+      A useful Cython type for getting quick access to blocks of memory. A memoryview alone does not actually own any memory. However, it can be initialized with a Python object that has the `buffer protocol`_ (typically \"array\" types, for example a Numpy array). It keeps a reference to that Python object alive and provides quick access to the memory without needing to go through the Python ``__getitem__``/``__setitem__`` methods.",
