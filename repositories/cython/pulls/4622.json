This allows member functions to be compared directly with nonmember functions so that all the alternatives for operators (member functions, non-member functions declared in a global scope, non-member functions declared in a class scope) can be evaluated in one go.\r\n\r\nIn the case where a single argument exists it evaluates the suitability in the `UnopNode.analyse_types` by attempting coercion. This basically matches what `BinopNode` currently does so seems a sensible approach.",
