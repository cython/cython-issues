    "body": "Hi, I'm adding a few things that should improve compatibility with GraalPy. I was testing with pre-release build of upcoming GraalPy 25.0 (implements Python 3.12).\r\n- Use datetime macros instead of struct access\r\n- Set `CYTHON_AVOID_THREAD_UNSAFE_BORROWED_REFS` to `0`. This macro seems to lead to code paths that assume Python 3.13.\r\n- Use new GraalPy public functions that are prefixed with `GraalPy`. We had to do a rename to prevent future name collisions with CPython (i.e. imagine if they add `PySlice_Start` with different refcounting semantics) and to make it clearer which APIs are GraalPy-specific.\r\n- Add partial support for `array`. Currently only implements the access to `data` and the resize functions that are used by scikit-learn\r\n\r\nI'm still working on getting the tests running again, I'll make another PR for that.",
