I still think that's a good idea in principle but it's actually quite hard - pyx files support a lot of syntax that isn't allowed in pxd files.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for some of this extra syntax. It currently looks to be passing so it only adds tests and doesn't make any other changes. I'm not sure what changes (if any) should happen to the pipelines, but I think it should support the features tested here so the tests are useful on their own.",
