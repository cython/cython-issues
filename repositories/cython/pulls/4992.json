Python <3.9 allowed `[i for i in range(10) if lambda: i]`\r\nwhile Python >=3.9 disallows this. Arguably it's pointless because\r\nthe lambda always evaluates to True. See\r\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/issues/86014\r\nfor the Python issue.\r\n\r\nWith this change Cython will follow the Python 3.9 behaviour at\r\nthe cost of potentially breaking some code that does use the\r\npattern above. If that isn't desirable I can produce an\r\nalternative change that fixes p_lambda_nocond instead.\r\n\r\nPart of cleanup in #4595.",

                "message": "Remove `p_lambdef_nocond` from the parser.\n\nNote that it wasn't correct before since it didn't pass the\ncorrect flag to `p_lambdef` and thus was equivalent to just\nusing `p_lambdef`.\n\nNote also that there's a difference in behaviour between Python3.9+\nand before. Python <3.9 allowed `[i for i in range(10) if lambda: i]`\nwhile Python >=3.9 disallows this. Arguably it's pointless because\nthe lambda always evaluates to True. See\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/issues/86014\nfor the Python issue.\n\nWith this change Cython will follow the Python 3.9 behaviour at\nthe cost of potentially breaking some code that does use the\npattern above. If that isn't desirable I can produce an\nalternative change that fixes p_lambda_nocond instead.\n\nPart of cleanup in #4595.",
