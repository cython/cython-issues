    "body": "This pull request adds support for a late ``#include``. My proposed syntax is to add a leading pipe to the filename:\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from \"|spam.h\":\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this `cdef extern` block, Cython will generate the `#include` statement *after* its own variable declarations. So it can be used if the C code in `spam.h` needs to refer to Cython variables.\r\n\r\n`cysignals` has a use-case which is currently \"solved\" by some ugly hack involving `.pxi` files (for which I need #483). If this pull request is accepted, `cysignals` would no longer need to rely on `.pxi` files: https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/pull/49\r\n\r\nOf course, there are plenty of bikeshedding opportunities for the syntax, but I care about the feature, not the syntax. I chose the leading pipe because it is unlikely to occur in actual filenames. (Also: think of the pipe as \"piping\" the Cython variables into the header file).",
