                "message": "When iterating over a literal C array in a generator, avoid storing the array in the closure.\nInstead, create it in place, inside the loop body, before looking up the current loop item.\nThis allows the C compiler to do its job making the loop efficient, but avoids the overhead of storing the C array remotely, and potentially restoring it from a closure temp on each iteration.\nPreviously in 3.2.0, we even failed to store away the C array at all, leaving it uninitialised in the next iteration.\n\nFixes https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7323",
