(Also add a test case for passing keyword\r\narguments, which already worked, but is good to have as a test\r\ncase).\r\n\r\nPEP3131 implies that normalization of identifiers should be done before tokenization (i.e. the moment any unicode character is found the surrounding area of code should be normalized then checked to see if it's an identifier). Practically, I don't think this is what Python does. Instead it finds a bit of string that might be an identifier and validates that it is (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/69f37bcb28d7cd78255828029f895958b5baf6ff/Parser/tokenizer.c#L1062). Normalization is done when the AST is generated (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/51aac15f6d525595e200e3580409c4b8656e8a96/Python/ast.c#L610).\r\n\r\nI've followed (what I believe is) Python's approach. This might make a different if some unicode characters that aren't valid start or continuation characters can get normalized to something that is. I don't think this happens though. And this patch should certainly take care of the majority of the cases.",
