This is probably fine for most compilers and platforms and even an implicit downcast seems unlikely to pose problems in real code, but it still made me try a refactoring of the conversion code that was apparently worth it.\r\n\r\nThe integer conversion code is now split into separate C functions that make it easier for the C compiler to reason about inlining. The micro-benchmarks that I added show no degradations but suggest tiny improvements for integer unpacking.",
