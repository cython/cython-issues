Unlike the previous PR it is fairly non-intrusive (i.e. doesn't wrap everything in `ResultRefNodes`) and therefore the changes should be more reasonable. Instead it:\r\n\r\n1. Gives `IteratorNode` a scope (pointed at the outer scope rather than the scope of the generator/comprehension)\r\n2. Tags each `ExprNode` inside the generator iterator sequence with a number, and uses those tags later to work out what needs to be converted to an argument for the generator. If an `ExprNode` is optimized out then that's fine - one of its children will have been tagged.\r\n",
