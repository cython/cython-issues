            "body": "An opening bracket doesn't necessarily enclose the first CM expression: `with (a+b).func(), c:`\r\n\r\nSo in stage 2 of your scheme it isn't clear if you need to include the bracket when parsing the first CM expression. In this case you must include the opening bracket or the parsing fails. But in the case of `with (a as x):` it'd be wrong to parse the bracket as part of the first CM expression.\r\n\r\n> (you can't have (a,b,c) or (a,) as valid CM expressions)\r\n\r\nThey're grammatically OK. They'll fail at runtime because a tuple doesn't have `__enter__` and `__exit__`.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe main thing to be said for the way I've done it is that it is how the current version of the Python grammar works... it tries to parse the bracket-enclosed version and if that fails tries to parse the non-bracket enclosed version. So although parsing twice is inefficient when you have to do it, it's fairly easily linked back to the Python grammar.",
