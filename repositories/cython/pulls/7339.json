I kept `ListNode` as a base class mostly just in case we need some of its functionality later on, but I'm not aware of anything specific that is needed. It could probably just be a `SequenceNode`.\r\n\r\nIt'd be a somewhat large change for 3.2.x but maybe not too risky. Thus also the `ListNode` base class, to reduce the risk of unanticipated changes.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7323",
