These were essentially the features that go beyond Python compatibility.\r\n\r\nSupport for unicode identifiers in C/C++ features such as structs and cppclasses. For structs used purely in Python I've mangled the names with punycode. For features that are exported/imported to C with \"public\" or \"extern\", I've translated the names to be \\uXXXX escaped (without any mangling or normalization). Pretty much every modern C/C++ compiler supports unicode in identifiers in this form (only Clang supports it in raw form I think), so this this seems like the most compatible thing to do. I've trusted that the user knows what names they want and not performed any normalization for these (I don't think normalization is yet defined in C/C++ standards, so it's hard to do anything else).",
