But the `WithTransform` also inherits from `SkipDeclarations` and therefore suffers from the same bug. Thus my preference for it (being a required syntax construct) over the `SwitchTransform`, which is an optional optimisation. I think it's reasonable to test here that all supported syntax works also inside of C++ classes and their methods. But we shouldn't rely on a specific optimisation being enabled or not. If you want to test those in the context of a C++ class, then you're right, it would best be done in a separate test file.",
