    "body": "This is the point where I got stuck when creating bindings for a C-library. Luckily I got help in the comments: https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3388#issuecomment-683672261. Later I found that there was some (minimal) documentation on `&`. I added a small sub-chapter to 'Interfacing with External C Code' to help noivce users who want to access external C-libraries that use functions with pointers. I linked to the cython documentation on differences with C pointer syntax.\r\n\r\nBackground information. I have been creating [bindings](https://github.com/rhpvorderman/python-isal) for the [isa-l](https://github.com/intel/isa-l.git) library. This required me to look at `zlibmodule.c` (from cpython) quite a lot. Both isa-l as `zlibmodule.c` contain a lot of pointers and pointer manipulation, so it would have been nice to know this info beforehand. Nevertheless Cython has saved me a lot of headaches, so I figured it would be nice to add the stuff I learned to the documentation to smoothen the experience for other novice users. Lots of thanks to all Cython developers for creating Cython!",
