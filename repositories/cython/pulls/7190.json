In this case PyObject will become\nopaque because it's different between freethreaded and regular\nbuilds and so Cython will need to handle most inheritance\nwithout including PyObject into the type struct.\n\nThis PR only covers cyfunction/fusedfunction and not the rest\nof the shared types, mostly as a proof of concept. I've also\nnot done it outside the Limited API, just because the regular\nAPI does the weird \"semi-inheritance from PyCFunction\" trick.\nFor regular cdef classes there might be some value in giving\nusers individual control.",
