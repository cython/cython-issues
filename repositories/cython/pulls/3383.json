Allow the type of `self` in a cdef class to be specified\r\n\r\n    As in this comment https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1274#issuecomment-525230079.\r\n    I've tried to follow existing behaviour with respect to type checking - self arg\r\n\r\n    This only works in Python 3 - reflecting the different behaviour of pure Python code:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    class C:\r\n      def f(self):\r\n        pass\r\n    C.f(1)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This works fine in Python 3 but fails in Python 2. I don't see an easy workaround for this. Maybe to create non-__PYX_CCLASS functions?\r\n\r\n2. Relax some restriction on cdef class properties/staticmethods/classmethods\r\n\r\n    Where it isn't able to do the efficient thing it falls back to calling the builtin method property/staticmethod/classmethod.\r\n\r\n    Properties are only special-cased where the property decorator is the only decorator. Having mismatching function names now generates a warning, not an error, and follows Python 3 (which is slightly counter-intuitive but fairly easily tested). Python 2 behaviour appears to be different. https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1905.\r\n\r\n    staticmethod/classmethod are only special-cased when the decorator is innermost.\r\n\r\n3. Fixes https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1274 - arbitrarily decorated methods fall back to \"ordinary\" functions as in the issue.\r\n\r\n    Where a method is arbitrarily decorated we don't really know the type of the `self` argument - it's probably just the type of the `cdef class`, but it could be anything else. Therefore, we produce a fused function with the `self` type either that of the `cdef class`, or `object`. Therefore both the likely case (where the `self` is the `cdef class` and we want access to `cdef` methods and attributes) is handled and the alternative case where `self` is some other object should also work. This behaviour can be overridden by specifying the type manually.\r\n\r\n    This is mostly transparent to the user, but if they look hard they will be able to tell it's a `cdef` function, mostly because the function has `__getitem__` defined.\r\n\r\n    I don't think the should break anything, but it might be possible to end up with one or the fused function definitions unable to compile, and that might be a problem....\r\n\r\n    I suspect it fixes\r\n    https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3072\r\n    https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3044\r\n    but the associated test-cases were large and fairly confusing\r\n\r\n    Fixes https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2181\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCurrent status (I think):\r\nTests passing on Python2 and 3. Some of the new flexibility doesn't work on Python2 but I hope there aren't any regressions.\r\n~At least one of the tests produces ref-counting errors (and also fails) when Cython is compiled but not when it isn't. This definitely needs investigation since it suggests something's really going wrong.~ This was related to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3384. This underlying issue isn't fixed but I no longer run into it here.",
