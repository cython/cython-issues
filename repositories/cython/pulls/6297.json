Extension modules that only use a safe subset of the Python C API (the Limited API)\n+get a forward-compatibility guarantee (the Stable ABI) which means that the extension module can \n+be used with any future version of Python, without recompilation.\n+\n+Cython is able to compile extension modules in Limited API mode from Cython 3.1 onwards\n+(Cython 3.0 had some support, but not enough to be practically useful).  Note that this is still\n+experimental - a lot of code is known to work but testing is currently incomplete so you may well\n+encounter bugs and missing features.\n+\n+From a user's point of view, the main benefit is that you only need to compile your Cython module\n+once and it will support a range of Python versions.\n+\n+Limitations\n+===========\n+\n+A number of features of Cython do not work in the Limited API.  Some of the important restrictions\n+are listed below, however this is non-exhaustive:\n+\n+* Extension types (``cdef classes``) cannot inherit from builtin types (e.g. ``list``).  This\n+  is a limitation of the current implementation and is likely to be removed in the future.\n+* Features like profiling and line-tracing are not supported, and are unlikely to ever be supported.\n+* ``cimport cpython`` is restricted.  Support for this is likely to improve, although you will\n+  never be able to use functions/structures that are unavailable in the Limited API through this\n+  interface.  Direct access to the ``array.array`` class is an example of a feature that will\n+  never work.\n+* Some features only work on specific versions of the Limited API.  The most significant is\n+  :ref:`memoryviews` which requires Python 3.11+ in Limited API mode.\n+* In many cases, Cython substitutes private C API for private Python API.  This means that\n+  complete forward compatibility with future versions of Python isn't assured (and with\n+  errors likely to be runtime errors rather than compile-time errors).\n+\n+Performance\n+===========\n+\n+Running in the Limited API has a notable performance cost.  If this is a concern then you\n+should measure it for your own module.  Some rough guidelines follow:\n+\n+Where the majority of the work involves C-level code the performance loss is likely to be\n+low.  This includes code that makes heavy use of typed memoryviews, or code that mainly calls\n+an external C library.\n+\n+Where the majority of the work involves interacting with Python objects the cost is likely to\n+be more significant.  As an example, compiling the Cython compiler with the regular C API\n+gives a ~35% speed-up compared to not compiling the Cython compiler.  Compiling the Cython\n+compiler in the Limited API gives a 0-10% speed-up (depending on the exact version used).\n+\n+If you are prepared to restrict yourself to Python versions 3.12+, then Cython will use\n+the \"vectorcall\" interface in Limited API mode.  This doesn't enable any new functionality,\n+but it does give a noticeable performance improvement. (Outside of the Limited API, Cython\n+almost always uses this interface).\n+\n+Building with the Limited API\n+=============================\n+\n+Cython's usage of the Limited API is controlled by setting the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` macro\n+when running the C compiler.  This macro should be set to the version-hex for the\n+minimum Python version that you want to support.  Useful version-hexes are:\n+\n+* ``0x03070000`` - Python 3.7 - the minimum version that Cython supports.\n+* ``0x030B0000`` - Python 3.11 - the first version to support typed memoryviews.\n+* ``0x030C0000`` - Python 3.12 - the first version to support vectorcall (performance\n+  improvement).\n+  \n+As well as setting the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` macro, you should also name the compiled\n+extension modules to indicate their use of the Stable ABI.  On OS X and Linux, this\n+means the extension modules names should end with ``.abi3.so``.\n+\n+A number of examples are shown below for different build systems, but the\n+same basic principles apply to any other build system.\n+\n+Setuptools and setup.py\n+-----------------------\n+\n+Using setup.py to control the compilation (as shown in the main :ref:`compilation`\n+documentation)::\n+\n+    from setuptools import Extension, setup\n+    from Cython.Build import cythonize\n+    \n+    setup(\n+        ext_modules=cythonize([\n+            Extension(\n+                name=\"cy_code\",\n+                sources=[\"cy_code.pyx\"],\n+                define_macros=[\n+                    (\"Py_LIMITED_API\", 0x03070000),\n+                ],\n+                py_limited_api=True\n+            ),\n+        ]))\n+        \n+The key differences are two arguments to ``Extension``:  ``define_macros`` and ``py_limited_api``.\n+The ``py_limited_api`` argument controls the naming of the extension module.\n+\n+Scikit-build",
