    "body": "The previous implementation was mostly unaware of the parsing context, whether C types were allowed at all or not. It returned what it found most appropriate. This was often wrong, e.g. for `Optional[float]`, where the Python `float` type is required in order to support None values.\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans this up and uses a status flag on the current scope to decide whether the analysis happens in a context that allows C types or whether the Python types should be preferred on ambiguity. Compatible types can also switch back and forth along the analysis path, specifically `float` / C `double`, `bool` / `bint` and `complex` / `double complex`. Since there is more than one such type, this equivalence was added to the type system.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3883",
