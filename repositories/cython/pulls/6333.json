That makes it easy to distinguish from the value `None` (as in \"no node\").\r\n\r\nAs you correctly wrote, the Python type is called `NoneType`, not `None`. The fact that Python uses `None` in the type system instead is simply that for users, typing `NoneType` is very unusual. Many programmers probably have never seen it but know `None` only as a constant value. Thus, `None` is ubiquitous and easy to read and understand as part of a type annotation – it allows `None` as a value, thus making the typed value optional.\r\n\r\nHowever, that doesn't mean that `None` *is* a type, or that we have to represent it as a type in Cython. Just check the type declaration node for `node.is_none` to see if we found `None` in the source code.",

I double checked it and without introducing `NoneType`, this code gets literal `None` value for both cases:\r\n\r\n* `Union[int, None]`\r\n* `Union[int, DummyType]`\r\n\r\nHence, without further changes I **cannot** distinguish following cases:\r\n1. non-recognized type - in this case we should evaluate annotation as `object`\r\n2. `None` value - in this case the type is candidate for evaluation of optional type - e.g. `Union[]`\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE] \r\n> To replicate it, just use master and put debug print/breakpoint in following line:\r\n> https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/5805f4c0078e24438edb931a9846f83674c22059/Cython/Compiler/PyrexTypes.py#L4775\r\n> Both cases\r\n> ```python\r\n> import typing\r\n> \r\n> def main(a: typing.Optional[Bar]):\r\n>     pass\r\n> ```\r\n> and\r\n> ```python\r\n> import typing\r\n> \r\n> def main(a: typing.Optional[None]):\r\n>     pass\r\n> ```\r\n> contains value `[None]` in variable `template_values`.\r\n\r\nHence, when I want to avoid introducing `NoneType` we need to introduce major structural changes how annotation is evaluated at least in following function (which feeds `specilize_here()`:\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/5805f4c0078e24438edb931a9846f83674c22059/Cython/Compiler/Nodes.py#L1254",
