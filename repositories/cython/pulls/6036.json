This feature is not\r\nentirely for free and can visibly increase the C compile time as well as adding 0-5% to the\r\nsize of the binary extension module. It can therefore be disabled using a C macro.\r\n\r\n* ``CYTHON_CLINE_IN_TRACEBACK=1`` always shows the C line number in tracebacks,\r\n* ``CYTHON_CLINE_IN_TRACEBACK=0`` never shows the C line number in tracebacks,\r\n\r\nIf the macro is *not* defined by the build setup or ``CFLAGS``, the feature is included and\r\ncan be enabled and disabled at runtime, at the before mentioned cost of longer C compile\r\ntimes and larger extension modules.\r\n  \r\nFor changing the value at runtime, you can import the special module ``cython_runtime``\r\nafter loading a Cython module and set the attribute ``cline_in_traceback`` in that module\r\nto either true or false to control the behaviour as your Cython code is being run.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the Cython option ``c_line_in_traceback`` or the command\r\nline argument ``--no-c-in-traceback`` could be used to disable this feature. This is still\r\npossible, but should be migrated to using the C macro instead.\r\n```",
