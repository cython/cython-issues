This feature needs C++17 (or boost optional) and so is off by default.\r\n\r\nIt's at a fairly preliminary stage currently - I need to make this work with globals, class attributes and closure variables for example. I also need to fix the compiler diagnostics that enforce no nullary constructors for . So it's really a draft to get some early feedback.\r\n\r\nLong-term I'd like to run (pretty much) the entire C++ test-suite with this turned on for at least one Python version - i.e. almost everything that works in C++ mode should work with this.\r\n\r\n",
