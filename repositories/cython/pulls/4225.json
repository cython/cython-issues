This feature needs C++17 (or boost optional) and so is off by default.\r\n\r\nIt work with globals, class attributes, and locals. Untested on closure variables currently.\r\n\r\nLong-term I'd like to run (pretty much) the entire C++ test-suite with this turned on for at least one Python version - i.e. almost everything that works in C++ mode should work with this. I'm not sure if this is feasible though - the following code (which is in the utility code) doesn't work (correctly)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef convert(list l):\r\n    cdef vector[int] vec  # not initialized\r\n    for item in l:\r\n        vec.push_back(item)\r\n    return vec\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is fine - but it does make it hard to test in bulk",

Defining\n+``CYTHON_USE_BOOST_OPTIONAL`` (as define for the C++ compiler) uses ``boost::optional``\n+instead (but is even more experimental and untested).

With this\n+directive they are only initialized at their first assignment, and thus\n+they no longer require a nullary constructor to be stack-allocated. Trying to\n+access an uninitialized C++ variable will generate an ``UnboundLocalError``\n+(or similar) in the same way as a Python variable would. For example::\n+\n+    def function(dont_write):\n+        cdef SomeCppClass c  # not initialized\n+        if dont_write:\n+            return c.some_cpp_function()  # UnboundLocalError\n+        else:\n+            c = SomeCppClass(...)  # initialized\n+            return c.some_cpp_function()  # OK\n+            \n+Additionally the directive avoids initializing temporary C++ objects before\n+they are assigned, for cases where Cython needs to use such objects in its\n+own code-generation (often for return values of functions that can throw\n+exceptions).\n+\n+For extra speed, the ``initializedcheck`` directive disables the check for an\n+unbound-local. With this directive on, accessing a variable that has not\n+been initialized will trigger undefined behaviour, and it is entirely the user's\n+responsibility to avoid such access.\n+\n+The ``cpp_locals`` directive is currently implemented using ``std::optional``\n+and thus requires a C++17 compatible compiler. Defining\n+``CYTHON_USE_BOOST_OPTIONAL`` (as define for the C++ compiler) uses ``boost::optional``\n+instead (but is even more experimental and untested). The directive does",
