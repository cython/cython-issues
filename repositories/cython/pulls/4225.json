With this directive on, accessing a variable that has not\n+been initialized will trigger undefined behaviour, and it is entirely the user's\n+responsibility to avoid such access.\n+\n+The ``cpp_locals`` directive is currently implemented using ``std::optional``\n+and thus requires a C++17 compatible compiler. Defining\n+``CYTHON_USE_BOOST_OPTIONAL`` (as define for the C++ compiler) uses ``boost::optional``\n+instead (but is even more experimental and untested).

With this\n+directive they are only initialized at their first assignment, and thus\n+they no longer require a nullary constructor to be stack-allocated. Trying to\n+access an uninitialized C++ variable will generate an ``UnboundLocalError``\n+(or similar) in the same way as a Python variable would. For example::\n+\n+    def function(dont_write):\n+        cdef SomeCppClass c  # not initialized\n+        if dont_write:\n+            return c.some_cpp_function()  # UnboundLocalError\n+        else:\n+            c = SomeCppClass(...)  # initialized\n+            return c.some_cpp_function()  # OK\n+            \n+Additionally the directive avoids initializing temporary C++ objects before\n+they are assigned, for cases where Cython needs to use such objects in its\n+own code-generation (often for return values of functions that can throw\n+exceptions).\n+\n+For extra speed, the ``initializedcheck`` directive disables the check for an\n+unbound-local. With this directive on, accessing a variable that has not\n+been initialized will trigger undefined behaviour, and it is entirely the user's\n+responsibility to avoid such access.\n+\n+The ``cpp_locals`` directive is currently implemented using ``std::optional``\n+and thus requires a C++17 compatible compiler. Defining\n+``CYTHON_USE_BOOST_OPTIONAL`` (as define for the C++ compiler) uses ``boost::optional``\n+instead (but is even more experimental and untested). The directive does",
