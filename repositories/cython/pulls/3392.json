This requires an\r\n  extra option to runtest.py \"--listfile\", which just runs through\r\n  the tests listed in the file.\r\n\r\n~I haven't made pypy2 a required test in this commit - since\r\nPython2 support is deprecated soon, there seemed limited value in\r\nputting much effort into pypy2.~",

This requires an\n  extra option to runtest.py \"--listfile\", which just runs through\n  the tests listed in the file.\n\nI haven't made pypy2 a required test in this commit - since\nPython2 support is deprecated soon, there seemed limited value in\nputting much effort into pypy2.",
