So it is exactly like the batch about method overloading: being able to define and not just declare.\r\nIf I have understood it properly, this addresses issue #1218\r\n\r\na) Make cppclass generate code for nested definitions (for example nested cppclass)\r\nb) Fix Symtab for the inherited nested types: this is basically the same thing than for other attributes, have a separate \"inherited types\" array, to be able to have them in scope but ignore them during code generation.\r\nc) Amend the nested classes test",
