Added two values of check_size to \"opaque\" and \"opaque_in_limited_api\". These don't check the object size at import (which avoids need to do sizeof on opaque types). However they're restricted so they can't be used as a way of disabling the size check.\r\n2. Added a compiler directive for cdef functions that wraps them in an `#if` guard. It's mainly for our internal use so undocumented but I'm fairly relaxed if people find and use it.\r\n\r\nWith these I can get all of the pxd files (except cpython.array.pxd) so that they can be be cimported in limited API mode. Of course, much of them won't work, but it won't present a compile error unless used. Which at least means that people can use the bits that do work.",

If they only override existing Python API (and we could even check that and restrict their removal to this case), then there's not much of a reason for them in the Limited API.\r\n\r\nYes. The difficulty is disabling them in the Limited API without blocking access to the Python API. I can't see a good way of doing that.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI've removed the changes in datetime.pxd since almost the whole thing was disabled in the Limited API so I think it's best to have a warning and give up.\r\n\r\nThat leaves:\r\n\r\n* `real`/`imag` in `complex.pxd`\r\n* A couple of inline module-scoped functions in `contextvar.pxd`.\r\n\r\nI think the module-scoped functions mean \"ignore inline methods/properties defined on builtin types\" wouldn't really work.\r\n\r\nSo the options are:\r\n* Do something similar to what I've done.\r\n* Rewrite them to work with the Limited API. For the complex ones, it'd be hard to make it truly `noexcept`. The contextvar ones would just have to use the Python API\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which is best.",

            "body": "> I've removed the changes in datetime.pxd since almost the whole thing was disabled in the Limited API so I think it's best to have a warning and give up.\r\n\r\nA warning seems ok here. It might be annoying for some, but then the best solution is to extract the C-API usages into a separate module that gets optionally built and imported when not using the Limited API. So there are still ways to write code for both targets.\r\n\r\n> A couple of inline module-scoped functions in `contextvar.pxd`.\r\n\r\nThere's already a verbatim code section at the top of the file that (stupidly) defines `PyContextVar_Get()` in older Python versions that lack it. We could reuse that for the Limited API to make it compile and add a warning as a comment that the contextvars C-API simply isn't available there. That would at least allow users to write code that uses the C-API if available and fall back to `import contextvars` otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe could also turn the macro into an inline function and then issue an actual Python warning if it gets called. That would help making users more aware of a problem in their code.\r\n\r\n> real/imag in complex.pxd\r\n\r\nSince these are Cython inline properties (and not Python properties), we could use a C inline function for the struct access that calls `PyObject_GetAttr()` in the Limited API.\r\n\r\nThe `noexcept` gets in the way then, though… but since failures should not occur in practice, we could still keep it and live with the \"unraisable exception\"…",

Added two values of check_size to \"opaque\" and\n   \"opaque_in_limited_api\". These don't check the object size at\n   import (which avoids need to do sizeof on opaque types). However\n   they're restricted so they can't be used as a way of disabling\n   the size check.\n2. Added a compiler directive for cdef functions that wraps them\n   in an `#if` guard. It's mainly for our internal use so undocumented\n   but I'm fairly relaxed if people find and use it.\n\nWith these I can get all of the pxd files (except cpython.array.pxd)\nso that they can be be cimported in limited API mode. Of course,\nmuch of them won't work, but it won't present a compile error\nunless used. Which at least means that people can use the bits that\ndo work.",
