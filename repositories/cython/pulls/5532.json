It now passes through the Mapping protocol first when supported.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`1807`)\n+\n+* Special methods for binary operators now follow Python semantics.\n+  Rather than e.g. a single ``__add__`` method for cdef classes, where\n+  \"self\" can be either the first or second argument, one can now define\n+  both ``__add__`` and ``__radd__`` as for standard Python classes.\n+  This behavior can be disabled with the ``c_api_binop_methods`` directive\n+  to return to the previous semantics in Cython code (available from Cython\n+  0.29.20), or the reversed method (``__radd__``) can be implemented in\n+  addition to an existing two-sided operator method (``__add__``) to get a\n+  backwards compatible implementation.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`2056`)\n+\n+* A warning was added when ``__defaults__`` or ``__kwdefaults__`` of Cython compiled\n+  functions were re-assigned, since this does not current have an effect.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`2650`)\n+\n+* When using type annotations, ``func(x: list)`` or ``func(x: ExtType)`` (and other\n+  Python builtin or extension types) no longer allow ``None`` as input argument to ``x``.\n+  This is consistent with the normal typing semantics in Python, and was a common gotcha\n+  for users who did not expect ``None`` to be allowed as input.  To allow ``None``, use\n+  ``typing.Optional`` as in ``func(x: Optional[list])``.  ``None`` is also automatically\n+  allowed when it is used as default argument, i.e. ``func(x: list = None)``.\n+  ``int`` and ``float`` are now also recognised in type annotations and restrict the\n+  value type at runtime.  They were previously ignored.\n+  Note that, for backwards compatibility reasons, the new behaviour does not apply when using\n+  Cython's C notation, as in ``func(list x)``.  Here, ``None`` is still allowed, as always.\n+  Also, the ``annotation_typing`` directive can now be enabled and disabled more finely\n+  within the module.\n+  (Github issues :issue:`2696`, :issue:`3883`, :issue:`4606`, :issue:`4669`, :issue:`4886`)\n+\n+* The builtin ``abs()`` function can now be used on C numbers in nogil code.\n+  Patch by Elliott Sales de Andrade.  (Github issue :issue:`2748`)\n+\n+* Cython no longer generates ``__qualname__`` attributes for classes in Python\n+  2.x since they are problematic there and not correctly maintained for subclasses.\n+  Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue :issue:`2772`)\n+\n+* Nested dict literals in function call kwargs could incorrectly raise an\n+  error about duplicate keyword arguments, which are allowed when passing\n+  them from dict literals.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`2963`)\n+\n+* The unicode methods ``.upper()``, ``.lower()`` and ``.title()`` were\n+  incorrectly optimised for single character input values and only returned\n+  the first character if multiple characters should have been returned.\n+  They now use the original Python methods again.\n+\n+* The ``self`` argument of static methods in .pxd files was incorrectly typed.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3174`)\n+\n+* Relative imports failed in compiled ``__init__.py`` package modules.\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`3442`)\n+\n+* Generator expressions in pxd-overridden ``cdef`` functions could\n+  fail to compile.\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`3477`)\n+\n+* Conditional blocks in Python code that depend on ``cython.compiled`` are\n+  eliminated at an earlier stage, which gives more freedom in writing\n+  replacement Python code.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3507`)\n+\n+* With ``language_level=3/3str``, Python classes without explicit base class\n+  are now new-style (type) classes also in Py2.  Previously, they were created\n+  as old-style (non-type) classes.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`3530`)\n+\n+* The ``print`` statement (not the ``print()`` function) is allowed in\n+  ``nogil`` code without an explicit ``with gil`` section.\n+\n+* ``repr()`` was assumed to return ``str`` instead of ``unicode`` with ``language_level=3``.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`3736`)\n+\n+* Self-documenting f-strings (``=``) were implemented.\n+  Patch by davfsa.  (Github issue :issue:`3796`)\n+\n+* Type inference now understands that ``a, *b = x`` assigns a list to ``b``.\n+\n+* Calls to ``.__class__()`` of a known extension type failed.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`3954`)\n+\n+* Annotations were not exposed on annotated (data-)classes.\n+  Patch by matsjoyce.  (Github issue :issue:`4151`)\n+\n+* Structs could not be instantiated with positional arguments in\n+  pure Python mode.\n+\n+* The dispatch code for binary operators to special methods could run into infinite recursion.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`4172`)\n+\n+* Attribute annotations in Python classes are now ignored, because they are\n+  just Python objects in a dict (as opposed to the fields of extension types).\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issues :issue:`4196`, :issue:`4198`)\n+\n+* Unsupported decorators on cdef functions were not rejected in recent releases.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`4322`)\n+\n+* Python object types were not allowed as ``->`` return type annotations.\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`4433`)\n+\n+* Cython did not type the ``self`` argument in special binary methods.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`4434`)\n+\n+* ``__qualname__`` and ``__module__`` were not available inside of class bodies.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4447`)\n+\n+* ``pyximport`` no longer uses the deprecated ``imp`` module.\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`4560`)\n+\n+* Reusing an extension type attribute name as a method name is now an error.\n+  Patch by 0dminnimda.  (Github issue :issue:`4661`)\n+\n+* The ``__self__`` attribute of fused functions reports its availability correctly\n+  with ``hasattr()``.  Patch by David Woods.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4808`)\n+\n+* The parser allowed some invalid spellings of ``...``.\n+  Patch by 0dminnimda.  (Github issue :issue:`4868`)\n+\n+* Unused ``**kwargs`` arguments did not show up in ``locals()``.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4899`)\n+\n+* Extended glob paths with ``/**/`` and ``\\**\\`` for finding source files failed on Windows.\n+\n+* The ``**`` power operator now behaves more like in Python by returning the correct complex\n+  result if required by math.  A new ``cpow`` directive was added to turn on the previous\n+  C-like behaviour.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4936`)\n+\n+* ``__del__`` finaliser methods were not always called if they were only inherited.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4995`)\n+\n+* Unknown type annotations (e.g. because of typos) now emit a warning at compile time.\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`5070`)\n+\n+* The special ``__*pow__`` methods now support the 2- and 3-argument variants.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`5160`)\n+\n+* ``typing.Optional`` could fail on tuple types.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`5263`)\n+\n+* The new complex vs. floating point behaviour of the ``**`` power operator accidentally\n+  added a dependency on the GIL, which was really only required on failures.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`5287`)\n+\n+* Function signatures containing a type like `tuple[()]` could not be printed.\n+  Patch by Lisandro Dalcin.

Previously it was\n+  ``include_directories``, ``Cython/Includes``, ``sys.path``. Now it is\n+  ``include_directories``, ``sys.path``, ``Cython/Includes``. This was done to\n+  allow third-party ``*.pxd`` files to override the ones in Cython.\n+  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue :issue:`2905`)\n+\n+* When importing the old Cython ``build_ext`` integration with distutils, the\n+  additional command line arguments leaked into the regular command.\n+  Patch by Kamekameha.  (Github issue :issue:`2209`)\n+\n+* ``pyximport`` now uses ``cythonize()`` internally.\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`2304`)\n+\n+* Parallel builds of Cython itself (``setup.py build_ext -j N``) failed on Windows.\n+\n+* ``Cython.Distutils.build_ext`` now uses ``cythonize()`` internally (previously\n+  known as ``new_build_ext``), while still supporting the options that were\n+  available in the old implementation (``old_build_ext``).\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`3541`)\n+\n+* ``.pxd`` files can now be :ref:`versioned <versioning>` by adding an\n+  extension like \"``.cython-30.pxd``\" to prevent older Cython versions (than\n+  3.0 in this case) from picking them up.  (Github issue :issue:`3577`)\n+\n+* An unnecessary slow-down at import time was removed from ``Cython.Distutils``.\n+  Original patch by Anthony Sottile.  (Github issue :issue:`4224`)\n+\n+* A compiler crash when running Cython thread-parallel from distutils was resolved.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4503`)\n+\n+* The ``Cython.Build.BuildExecutable`` tool no longer executes the program automatically.\n+  Use ``cythonrun`` for that.\n+\n+* Cython now detects when existing output files were not previously generated\n+  by itself and refuses to overwrite them.  It is a common mistake to name\n+  the module file of a wrapper after the library (source file) that it wraps,\n+  which can lead to surprising errors when the file gets overwritten.\n+\n+* Improve compatibility between classes pickled in Cython 3.0 and 0.29.x\n+  by accepting MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 checksums.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4680`)\n+\n+* The environment variable ``CYTHON_FORCE_REGEN=1`` can be used to force ``cythonize``\n+  to regenerate the output files regardless of modification times and changes.\n+\n+* A new Cython build option ``--cython-compile-minimal`` was added to compile only a\n+  smaller set of Cython's own modules, which can be used to reduce the package\n+  and install size.\n+\n+\n+Deprecations\n+------------\n+\n+[text?]\n+\n+Related fixes\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+* Variables can no longer be declared with ``cpdef``.\n+  Patch by David Woods.  (Github issue :issue:`887`)\n+\n+* Dotted filenames for qualified module names (``pkg.mod.pyx``) are deprecated.\n+  Use the normal Python package directory layout instead.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`2686`)\n+\n+* The compile-time ``DEF`` and ``IF`` statements are deprecated and generate a warning.\n+  They should be replaced with normal constants, code generation or C macros.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4310`)\n+\n+* The undocumented, untested and apparently useless syntax\n+  ``from somemodule cimport class/struct/union somename`` was removed.  The type\n+  modifier is not needed here and a plain ``cimport`` of the name will do.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`4904`)\n+\n+* C-style array declarations (``cdef int a[4]``) are now (silently) deprecated in\n+  favour of the Java-style ``cdef int[4] a`` form.  The latter was always available\n+  and the Python type declaration syntax already used it exclusively (``a: int[4]``).\n+  Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`5248`)\n+\n+\n+Editor support\n+--------------\n+\n+Related fixes\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+* An endless loop in ``cython-mode.el`` was resolved.\n+  Patch by Johannes Mueller.  (Github issue :issue:`3218`)\n+\n+* The Emacs Cython mode file ``cython-mode.el`` is now maintained in a separate repo:\n+  https://github.com/cython/emacs-cython-mode\n+\n+* The C code shown in the annotated HTML output could lack the last C code line(s).\n+\n+* C compiler warnings and errors are now shown in Jupyter notebooks.\n+  Patch by Egor Dranischnikow.  (Github issue :issue:`3751`)\n+\n+\n+Other changes\n+-------------\n+\n+* ``--no-capture`` added to ``runtests.py`` to prevent stdout/stderr capturing\n+  during srctree tests.\n+  Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue :issue:`2701`)\n+\n+* The ``Tempita`` module no longer contains HTML processing capabilities, which\n+  were found to be broken in Python 3.8 and later.\n+  Patch by Marcel Stimberg.  (Github issue :issue:`3309`)\n+\n+* Binary Linux wheels now follow the manylinux2010 standard.\n+  Patch by Alexey Stepanov.  (Github issue :issue:`3355`)\n+\n+* Parts of the documentation were (and are being) rewritten to show the\n+  Cython language syntax next to the equivalent Python syntax.\n+  Patches by 0dminnimda and Matúš Valo.  (Github issue :issue:`4187`)\n+\n+* The wheel building process was migrated to use the ``cibuildwheel`` tool.\n+  Patch by Thomas Li.  (Github issue :issue:`4736`)\n+\n+* Wheels now include a compiled parser again, which increases their size a little\n+  but gives about a 10% speed-up when running Cython.\n+\n+* Cython now uses a ``.dev0`` version suffix for unreleased source installations.\n+\n+* ``setup.cfg`` was missing from the source distribution.\n+  (Github issue :issue:`5199`)\n+\n+* The FAQ page was moved from the GitHub Wiki to the regular documentation\n+  to make it more visible.\n+\n+\n+vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\n+vvv    TO DISTRIBUTE TO PROPER SECTIONS ABOVE    vvv\n+vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv",
