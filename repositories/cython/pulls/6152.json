This adds bindings for `Py_REFCNT` to the `cpython.ref` namespace and replaces all usages of `ob_refcnt` in the tests and docs with the new bindings for the macro.\r\n\r\nNote there are still `ob_refcnt` usages in the cython implementation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/023d4af351042a3b6241dbe06cbb003b3ce1fb58/Cython/Utility/Coroutine.c#L1283\r\n\r\nHowever it's guarded by a `#if !CYTHON_USE_TP_FINALIZE` so in practice the nogil build doesn't hit it. It also wasn't clear to me what to do about a usage that mutates the refcount but explicitly can't use the refcounting macros.",
