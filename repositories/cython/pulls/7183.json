And this PR has investigation that demonstrates that the hang happens with `fork` on Linux. The problem isn't with that at all but with `multiprocessing` and the way it intercepts exceptions in workers (or rather completely forgets to handle some and workers dying go unnoticed in the main process).\r\nLinking the issue but not the PR is misleading because the actual relevant info is in the PR.\r\nI you want just one link, this should be a PR.\r\n```suggestion\r\n  Patch by :user:`Sviatoslav Sydorenko <webknjaz>`.
