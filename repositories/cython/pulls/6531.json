    "body": "# Introduction\r\nThis PR is PoC for approach for generating and using shared library of internal utiity code. Cython currently creates pretty big .so files which causes issues for the clients see #6042, #6045, https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/27767. Proposed approach generates shared library containing MemoryView utility code which is loaded via standard cimport mechanism.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nConsider following .pyx file:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ndef add_one(int[:] buf):\r\n    for x in range(buf.shape[0]):\r\n        buf[x] += 1\r\n```\r\nWhen compiling using command `cythonize -3fib test.pyx`, cython will produce binary with size **`774K`**. With this PR, the resulting binary size is **`192K`**.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> The size of the shared library is 805K but this size is shared with multiple files instead to be included n-times.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Generate shared library - this step generates .C file containing Memoryview utility code (for now only from `Utility/MemoryView.pyx`). New argument `--generate-shared` is used for the purpouse:\r\n   ```\r\n   cython --generate-shared=MemoryView.c\r\n   \r\n   gcc -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -g -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat - \r\n   Werror=format-security -g -fwrapv -O2 -g -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wdate-time - \r\n   D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fPIC -I/root/dev/cython311/include -I/usr/include/python3.11 -c MemoryView.o\r\n   \r\n   gcc -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -g -fwrapv -O2 -g -fwrapv -O2 -g -fstack-protector- \r\n   strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 MemoryView.o -o MemoryView.cpython- \r\n   311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\r\n   ```\r\n2. Compile your `.pyx` code:\r\n   ```\r\n   cython -3 --shared=CYSHARED_PKG.MemoryView test.pyx\r\n   \r\n   x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -g -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat - \r\n   Werror=format-security -g -fwrapv -O2 -g -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wdate-time - \r\n   D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fPIC -I/root/dev/cython311/include -I/usr/include/python3.11 -c test.c -o \r\n   test.o\r\n   \r\n   x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -g -fwrapv -O2 -g -fwrapv -O2 -g -fstack-protector- \r\n   strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 test.o -o \r\n   test.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\r\n   ```\r\n3. Import and use the compiled example:\r\n   > Note: `MemoryView` library must be located in the `CYSHARED_PKG` Python path:\r\n   ```python\r\n   >>> import test\r\n   >>> from array import array\r\n   >>> a = array('i', [1,2,3])\r\n   >>> test.add_one(a)\r\n   >>> a\r\n   array('i', [2, 3, 4])\r\n\r\n   ``` \r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nImplementation consist of following parts:\r\n* `@cname` decorator was extended to support also function declarations\r\n* .pxd pipeline was extended to support `@cname` decorators\r\n* `.pxd` file was added to `Utility.MemoryView.pyx`, `shared` section was carved out which is not included anymore to the compiled files\r\n* Build pipeline was extended to add shared library to cimported libraries\r\n* New pipeline and CLI argument was added to generate new shared library\r\n\r\n# Current status of PR\r\n- [x] Fully unctional code - https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6531#issuecomment-2621385511\r\n- [x] shared library .pxd file can/should be templated\r\n- [x] shared library should be tested in CI/CD\r\n- [x] Shared library enabled via Compilation directive instead of option (requires #6646)\r\n- [x] CLI finalised, how we will specify the shared library - via import path?\r\n- [x] https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6531/files#r1930344662\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n# Open questions to be answered\r\n- [x] How we will provide shared library to the users:\r\n       - users can generate shared library or \r\n       - Cython can provide pip dependency package for that (here can be issue how we will manage versions)\r\n- [x] How will look CLI for generating shared library and to instruct compiler to use shared library instead of generating Utility Code\r\n- [x] How we will control which functions are loaded - this will be problem in future when more and more utility code will be able to include in shared library\r\n\r\n\r\n# Future improvements (out of scope of this PR)\r\n- Currently, there are some warnings of some not used memoryview utility functions. They are defined in C part of utility code which was not touched in this PR to keep this PR simple. \r\n- For now *only* part of MemoryView code is included but there is possibility to include other cython Utility code\r\n- C Utility code is also possible to shared code which will save even more binary size. I have dirty PoC for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #2356",
