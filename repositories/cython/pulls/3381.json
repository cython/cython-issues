A fused function enforces that it is C.\n\nC.f() # fails with a fused function claiming too few arguments, even though\n # default arguments may make it a valid call\n```\n\nObviously removing checks does make things a little less safe, but it\nis consistent with the more general function behaviour. (I'm doing\nthis as part of a broad plan to abuse fused functions to be a bit\ncleverer about decorators, but I don't think the motivation hugely\nmatters for this change)",
