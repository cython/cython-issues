    "body": "When cython is run on a file that is not in the current working directory it outputs filepaths that are either absolute or are basenames. It is not good to output absolute paths in the generated C code and outputing only basenames messes up coverage measurement.\r\n\r\nPartial fix for gh-6186. In combination with https://github.com/flintlib/python-flint/pull/188 this makes it possible to measure coverage of Cython for for python-flint which uses meson as its build system.\r\n\r\nThe two places changed here were inconsistent. In ModuleNodes.py the code detects an absolute path and then outputs `basename(path)` instead. The path in question will usually not be absolute but it will be absolute if the source file being compiled is not in CWD and so in that case it is the basename that is emitted to the generated C code. The case in ExprNodes.py outputs the path without checking but again that will be an absolute path if the source file is not iin CWD.\r\n\r\nHere in both cases we instead output the \"description\" which is the path relative to import root. If the project has a `src` directory then the path output for `src/foo/bar.pyx` (module `foo.bar`) would be `foo/bar.pyx` i.e. it is the path relative to the `src` directory or more generally the path of the source file relative to `sys.path`. In both cases we only do this if we would otherwise output an absolute path which in turn is a case that arises from compiling a `.pyx` file in another directory sort of like:\r\n```\r\ncd build && cython ../src/foo/bar.pyx\r\n```\r\nThis change is needed to make coverage measurement work in a meson build. In https://github.com/flintlib/python-flint/pull/188 I have almost entirely rewritten Cython's coverage plugin: \r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Coverage.py.\r\nThis PR for Cython and that one for python-flint together make it so that I can measure coverage in python-flint's meson build. (This is the last outstanding item for us to drop the setuptools build.)\r\n\r\nThe only significant thing I have kept in the rewritten plugin is the function for parsing the .c files. The rest of the code is just for discovering the source files and implementing the coverage plugin interface. A lot of that is meson-specific because it is a lot easier to implement those parts if you make use of the information provided by the build system (much of the complexity in Cython's plugin comes from just not knowing where exactly the .c and .pyx etc files are).\r\n\r\nI would like to upstream that plugin somehow but I'm not sure that Cython itself is the right place for it because a lot of it is meson specific. I also think that changing anything about Cython's coverage plugin looks quite hairy because there are a lot of heuristics in there to make different (setuptools-based) situations just about work and I expect that any change will break someone.\r\n\r\nFor now though, this PR which fixes the paths that Cython stores in the .c files is the minimum that is needed to get coverage working for a meson build. This is needed because there's only so much a plugin can do if the paths in the trace events are not right. At least under the conditions that I am running Cython the change in this PR ensures that all the paths provided from coverage to the plugin are exactly of a predictable form that the plugin can handle without heuristics.",

            "body": "The first case here (`res1`) is the typical setuptools case. This PR is intended not to change what happens in that case when cython is run from within cwd. Cython's coverage plugin already works in that case.\r\n\r\nThe second case here is what happens when building with meson or cmake. The behaviour on master would be to output a mixture of basename `bar.pyx` and absolute `/home/.../bar.pyx` paths. The change here is that all paths are `foo/bar.pyx` which is relative to sys.path in the sense that the built module would be imported as `foo.bar` rather than `src.foo.bar`.\r\n\r\nThe test case shows that actually the first case (`res1`) is a bit inconsistent. I actually think that it would be better if the second case `res2` was always the output generated by Cython regardless of CWD and that in fact Cython should not use CWD for anything besides parsing relative paths at the CLI. Changing that first case `res1` to be like `res2` would likely break some things including possibly Cython's current coverage plugin when using setuptools.\r\n\r\nUsing import-relative paths (`foo/bar.pyx`) is the most robust choice given that at cythonisation time there is no way to know where the built module will end up (e.g. site-packages, a different machine etc) or what the CWD will be when the module is actually imported. All we can really say is that the module will end up being on `sys.path` under a directory `foo` so it makes sense to use `foo/bar.pyx` as the canonical path that is baked into the source and used for trace events. The coverage plugin is then responsible for knowing that in the source tree `foo/bar.pyx` is a path relative to `src` so that from project root the relative path would be `src/foo/bar.pyx`.\r\n\r\nThis PR only changes the second case `res2` which on master is broken at least as far measuring coverage goes. Hopefully then that is only an improvement without breaking something.",

A Unix path can contain `\\` as character:\r\n```bash\r\n$ touch abcdefg\\\\xyz\r\n$ ls abcdefg\\\\xyz\r\n'abcdefg\\xyz'\r\n```\r\nOTOH, Windows directory names can actually contain `/`, and `.as_posix()` doesn't try to escape that either.\r\n\r\nIt seems slightly fragile to \"normalise\" path names like this, but I guess users would try to avoid them – at least after running into them once.",
