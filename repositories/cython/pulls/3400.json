Probably not a huge issue, but don't really see a\r\nway round that.\r\n\r\nAs part of this I've also also implemented a Cython version of `typing.ClassVar`. Although really designed for use with dataclasses it behaves sensibly when used in types in a normal `cdef class`. Potentially this might be worth documenting more thoroughly?\r\n\r\nTODO: frozen? - when set it either needs to set attributes to readonly\r\nand/or at least enforce readonlyness\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen finished closes https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2903 -\r\nhowever, some design decisions pending before it's finished:\r\n\r\nWhat attributes should be included in the dataclass? Definitely annotated variables. Maybe regular `cdef` variables?\r\n\r\nWhat should the visibility of the attributes be? There's a few options:\r\n1. Default to invisible, like for a standard `cdef class`. This is obviously consistent. The issue with this is that there's a few functions in the `dataclasses` module like [`asdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.asdict) which assume that every attribute declared in `__dataclass_fields__` is readable. If they aren't then the classes won't be compatible with those interfaces.\r\n\r\n     If so, should non-public attributes be omitted from `__dataclass_fields__`? This seems inconsistent since they do appear in the destructor, the repr, and affect the comparisons.\r\n\r\n2. Default to visible. This is inconsistent with the standard `cdef class` behaviour, but would make them as compatible as possible with standard `dataclasses`. It would also make sense for most use-cases I think. One problem is that the syntax doesn't really exist of override that (only `public` and `readonly` are defined).\r\n\r\n3. Annotated variables default to visible, `cdef` variables to invisible? It kind of makes sense and gives a way to control visibility, but it'd be a little inconsistent with everything. (I'm leaning towards this as the answer)\r\n\r\nThe likely implementation deviates from the normal `cdef class` behaviour where\r\n```\r\ncdef class C:\r\n   a: `int` = 0\r\n```\r\nmakes a class-variable instead of an instance variable. I think this is unavoidable and makes sense in this case, but comments on this welcome too?\r\n\r\nIt dumps a number of names in the `cython` scope (`dataclass`, `field`, `InitVar`, `ClassVar`). Would some sort of subscoping be better? Especially given that it isn't 100% obvious that any of these but `dataclass` related to dataclasses?",
