I think that's OK for something\r\nthat's designed to help users not to shoot themselves in the\r\nfoot rather than a core feature. Supporting earlier versions\r\nwould probably be more intrusive.\r\n\r\n* The test case is in \"errors\" rather than \"run\" even though its\r\nchecking for runtime errors. I decided that was the most\r\nsuitable place, but maybe I'm wrong...\r\n\r\n* It's interesting that Python is more lenient on multiple\r\ninheritence of cdef classes that Cython would be if \"C\" were\r\ndefined as cdef classes\r\n\r\n* Some of these errors could be detected at compile-time in\r\nprinciple too. This seems like a lot of effort given that we'll\r\nneed the runtime check anyway. Thus I haven't done it.",
