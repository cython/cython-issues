    "body": "Closes #2912 \r\n\r\nPer the comment on the issue, this turns `NameNodes` for `__class__` into `ClassCellNodes`, so that you can call `__class__` inside methods without qualifying with `self`. I believe that this fix is effectively just replacing `__class__` with `<name of class>` in these expressions, EG, no `__class__` local ends up created. \r\n\r\nThis is quite a minimal fix. There are a few remaining differences in `__class__` behaviour but I wasn't sure how to proceed with them, so I thought I'd raise a PR for comment. \r\n\r\nBasically, in non-Cythonized Python it appears that `__class__` is a bit of a \"magic\" local. If it appears anywhere in a method body, then `locals()` will contain `__class__` pointing to the containing class, anywhere in the function, but if it doesn't, then it won't. So:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A:\r\n    def b(self):\r\n        print(locals())\r\n        __class__\r\n```\r\n`A().b()` will print `['self', '__class__']`. As would \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A:\r\n    def b(self):\r\n        __class__\r\n        print(locals())\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A:\r\n    def b(self):\r\n        print(locals())\r\n```\r\nwould print only `['self']`\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is hard to achieve with the current PR, because instead of creating a local called `__class__` we are just replacing the `NameNode` with a `ClassCellNode`. As a result, when cythonized, in all the above examples `locals()` just prints `['self']`. \r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, some approaches that might be better: \r\n\r\n- Instead of replacing the `NameNode`, inject an `entry` into the current scope called `__class__` pointing to the containing `__class__` object. This requires rewriting `FuncLocalsExprNode` so that it iterates over the keys in `entries` rather than calling `.name` on each one. I tried this and it sort of worked but it was a bit messy manually updating the entries dictionary, maybe there's a better way?\r\n\r\n- From a higher level in the tree (the `DefNode`?) iterating through all of the statements in the body checking to see if any of them contain `__class__` and, if so, injecting it as a local.  \r\n\r\n- Without bothering to see if it's in the body or not, just always injecting `__class__` into the method scope (it's harmless if unused and I don't think it's unreasonable to interpret PEP3135 as implying it should always be in the `locals()` symbol table. However, I am far from an expert and there is potentially a good reason why Python doesn't put it into `locals()` for methods not containing `__class__`.)\r\n\r\nEager to get any and all feedback on the above! This is my first time touching the Cython codebase so I might have missed some things, but it's been really fun to dig into.\r\n",
