If we ever add new wrapping nodes or change the way the nodes are wrapped, we'll almost certainly forget to update at least some places where they were previously unwrapped.\r\n\r\nWe could have a generic `ExprNode.unpacked_node()` method that returns `self` unless specially overridden by utility nodes. That would be nice because it would also work recursively, with multiply wrapped nodes. But maybe that's not something for right now. Could be done as part of the 3.1 cleanup.",

The assumption is that they are\n   will most likely end up pointed to the same thing when they are\n   reused.\n3. When memoryview slices (temps and regular variables) are reassigned\n   it checks if the left-hand side and the right-hand side have\n   the same underlying memoryview. If so (likely!) then it skips\n   all reference counting.\n\nThis gets a 10x speed up for a toy example of\n\n```\ndef f(double[:,:] x):\n  for i in range(x.shape[0]):\n    a = x[i,:]\n```\n\nso it's probably worthwhile to do something similar to this.",
