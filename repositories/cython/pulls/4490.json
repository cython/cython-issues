    "body": "This PR is a first effort for the long-term goal to add an [HPy](https://github.com/hpyproject/hpy) backend to Cython. The main objective here is to get some feedback on how to structure the code and what else needs to be considered. So, this is an explicit request for comments.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to move C code generation into the `CCodeWriter`. For that, I've introduced a new class `HPyCodeWriter` that inherits from `CCodeWriter` and the new writer emits HPy API calls/code instead of CPython API calls/code. Then, we can use two different writers to run the same generation step.\r\n\r\nAs we have already discussed in a meeting on September 3rd, 2021 with @scoder, Cython now emits C API and HPy API code and the different sections are protected by ifdefs like this:\r\n```\r\n# ifndef HPY\r\n  /* C API code */\r\n#endif\r\n\r\n#ifdef HPY\r\n  /* HPy API code */\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\nThis is realized by introducing code sections for HPy (see `Code.py: code_layout`).\r\nSome of the sections are independent of the API and can be shared (e.g. `string_decls` which defines global `const char *` variables).\r\n\r\nA lot of work still needs to be done (of course) but the first simple example `hpy_basic.py` is already working (C only).",

IIUC, `Dup()` is just `(INCREF(ref), ref)` (for which we have `__Pyx_NewRef()`), `Close()` is just `DECREF()`. We should just adapt the refnanny macros for this and then use `new_ref = __Pyx_NewRef(old_ref)` wherever we currently use an assignment with `INCREF`. Even for CPython, that feels cleaner to me. We can also use an inline function for this to allow passing the results of non-trivial expressions directly (without requiring simple reference variables for macros).",
