In Python 3 it is technically allowed (although it's an odd thing to do)\r\n2. It's a step to supporting arbitrary decorators - as soon as a decorator is applied to a method it can change the `self` argument in all kinds of ways (for example the `classmethod` and `staticmethod` decorators). Allowing the user to override the `self` method would give more flexibility about how decorators could be used in methods of `cdef` classes.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nRelevant comments copied over from the older PR (in the interests of being transparent that it wasn't a completely popular idea):\r\n\r\nscoder:\r\n> I'm not convinced of this feature yet. I think it's worth a separate discussion. There might be other ways to achieve the original intention, for example.\r\n\r\nda-woods:\r\n> Do you mean \"you're not convinced it should be possible to override the type of self\" or \"this way of doing it is probably not the right way\"?\r\n\r\nscoder:\r\n> I'm not convinced it should be possible to override the type of self. Being able to call a type's method on something that is not the type? How is that not a static method then?\r\n\r\nda-woods:\r\n> The main counter-argument is that it is possible in Python 3 where functions and methods are the same thing.\r\n>\r\n> The difference between it and a static method is that in staticmethod always drops the self argument whether you call it with an instance or not, but it is acting very similar to a static method.\r\n>\r\n> I definitely don't think this would be a good thing to do regularly. jdemeyer claimed to have use cases for it so maybe could suggest a good reason? I'd mainly implemented it here because it seemed like a necessary step for the arbitrary decorator support.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nI suggest treating this PR as fairly low priority - I don't think it's hugely useful without changes to decorators (to follow)",
