And that would be totally ok in most cases, because it is what transforms are there for.\r\n\r\nAs a totally sidetracked BTW: what happens if we nest assignment expressions, like `(a := (b := x))`?

Or is the improved editor hints helpful enough to justify it.\r\n\r\nI guess the danger is that they do eventually end up enforced somehow...\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n> As a totally sidetracked BTW: what happens if we nest assignment expressions, like (a := (b := x))? Is that special in any way? Can it be special? Should it be special?\r\n\r\nIt works. It isn't special. For pyobject assignment expressions it generates slightly more reference counting than it needs to. There's a comment further down saying\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> # TODO - there's a missed optimization in the code generation stage\r\n> # if self.rhs.arg is temp: an incref/decref pair can be removed\r\n> # (but needs a general mechanism to do that)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI think if that were fixed then nested assignment expressions would be close to optimal. So I don't think they need to be special, but they could be improved along with some other things.",
