The pattern is pretty similar to std::optional. This gives a little extra flexibility in terms of the C++ classes that Cython can handle.\r\n    \r\n(built on top of https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3792 for simplicity, but needn't require that - it only requires a change to some #if lines)\r\n\r\nLonger-term it might be possible to support something similar for regular cdef variables, but it'd probably need some extra syntax since I doubt we'd want to change the default behaviour.",

This gives a little\nextra flexibility in terms of the C++ classes that Cython can handle.\n\n(built on top of https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3792\nfor simplicity, but needn't require that - it only requires a change\nto some #if lines)\n\nLonger-term it might be possible to support something similar for\nregular cdef variables, but it'd probably need some extra syntax\nsince I doubt we'd want to change the default behaviour.",
