Is this module the best place to put something like that?\r\n\r\nYes - ModuleSetupCode.c contains the bit of utility code that's always included, and is where the centralized stuff goes.\r\n\r\nAs I said in another comment - if we change it then I think think we should change it absolutely everywhere at once (with a big find/replace).\r\n\r\nThe naming scheme for Cython helper macros is `__Pyx_something` so they should stick to that. e.g. `__Pyx_Py_INCREF`",

In that light, `__Pyx_Py_INCREF()` is fine, since it at least suggests that it doesn't do more than `Py_INCREF()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, having both seems generally confusing…",
