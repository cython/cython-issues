    "body": "It should be safe to block for the GIL while holding the lock provided we never do it the other way around (which we don't because we control access to the lock). That probably makes things worse if you're mixing locking with and without the GIL, but it does at least mean that you eventually succeed.\r\n\r\nAdd a manual benchmark that can be used to measure it. I don't think it makes sense as an automatic benchmark because you're interested in both wall-clock time and CPU time, but it was useful while investigating this.\r\n\r\nI also note that in some cases (very contended, with both timeouts set to 0) the PyMutex never seems to finish. This isn't something we can really control but arguably it might be worth documenting.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7023 and the comment https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6579#discussion_r2176556402",

                "message": "Improve heavily contended PyThreadType lock\n\nIt should be safe to block for the GIL while holding the lock\nprovided we never do it the other way around (which we don't\nbecause we control access to the lock). That probably\nmakes things worse if you're mixing locking with and without\nthe GIL, but it does at least mean that you eventually\nsucceed.\n\nAdd a manual benchmark that can be used to measure it. I\ndon't think it makes sense as an automatic benchmark because\nyou're interested in both wall-clock time and CPU time, but\nit was useful while investigating this.\n\nI also note that in some cases (very contended, with both\ntimeouts set to 0) the PyMutex never seems to finish. This\nisn't something we can really control but arguably it might\nbe worth documenting.",
