When using an out place build with a `cythonize`-ed extension, before the path of any source file is used to generate the paths to the corresponding `.c` and `.o` files, the source file path is first cleaned up. This proceeds in two steps:\r\n\r\n- `os.path.normpath(pth)` is called, which will resolve any `../` in the middle of the path, or bubble them over to the left side.\r\n\r\n- If `pth` is a relative path, all leading `../` elements are then removed. If `pth` is absolute, then we don't need to both checking for any `../`.\r\n\r\nThis approach should allow for the use of src paths like `\"../../../src/foo.pyx\"` in `cythonize`-ed extensions, while still preserving enough path to prevent generated files from clobbering one another.",
