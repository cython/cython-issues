            "body": "@scoder, thanks for feedback. I believe it is better to keep `print*` outside. Let me explain: `test_X` function verifies method X for consistency in between Py and Cy implementation and allows the test to verify actual result. Some results are strings, some boolean, some integers. We use `print`/`print_all` only for strings and list of strings kinds of result. We do not use print for boolean and integer results.\r\n\r\nSo for consistency I suggest to keep all `test_*` functions as close as possible to each other: retrieve py and cy values, assert that they are the same and return that result for inspection. Then in the tests themselves it will be always clear what to expect from `test_X`: it does call `unicode.X` and returns the result.\r\n\r\nDo you think that makes sense?\r\n\r\n",

Tests also become a bit more robust because the\npossibility of slight unintended error in between py and cy inputs is now\ngone.\n\nThis refactoring is done in preparation to add more tests for unicode\nmethods that accept start and stop parameters.\n\nDiscussion: https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4737#issuecomment-1100220378",
