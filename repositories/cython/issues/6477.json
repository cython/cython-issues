This won't be true in free-threading builds. (Note for the benefit of readers: _you should never assume that this block will execute atomically; that's never been true and lots of operations can end up releasing the GIL_).\r\n\r\nIt'd probably be useful to provide:\r\n\r\nA lock type\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nA convenient lock type that uses any of `PyMutex`, a standard library mutex, or `PyThread_lock` depending on what's available. Users should probably be able to initialize this lock type at module scope, class scope or function scope. (At module scope it should likely _not_ be stored on the module-state?)\r\n\r\nAn efficient way of using that lock type with a `with` block. I'd suggest having three options to call it:\r\n* `with cython.locked(lock):`\r\n* `with cython.locked_and_gil(lock):`\r\n* `with cython.locked_or_gil(lock):` (i.e. on non-freethreading builds, get the GIL instead).\r\n\r\nThe `cython.locked_and_gil` will have to be somewhat careful to avoid deadlocks. And `cython.locked` probably will too (if called within a section that already has the GIL).\r\n\r\nAt this stage I don't think we should provide too much extra functionality (e.g. no option to release the lock for a section).\r\n\r\nAccess to Python critical sections\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAllow users to access Python critical sections for (one or two) objects for a block.\r\n\r\n* `with cython.criticical_section(o)`\r\n\r\nThese I think would only apply when the GIL is already held so probably only needs one variant. It can probably just be a no-op in the non-freethreading version.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen how useful the guarantee provided by a critical section is to a regular user, but there's little harm in us providing it.",
