Cython generates incorrect code for `sizeof` by substituting one type for another.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from \"foo.h\":\r\n    ctypedef long slong\r\n    ctypedef unsigned long ulong\r\n\r\nsizeof_slong = sizeof(slong)\r\nsizeof_ulong = sizeof(ulong)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe generated code looks like this:\r\n```\r\n  /* \"t.pyx\":5\r\n *     ctypedef unsigned long ulong\r\n * \r\n * sizeof_slong = sizeof(slong)             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n * sizeof_ulong = sizeof(ulong)\r\n */\r\n  __pyx_t_2 = __Pyx_PyInt_FromSize_t((sizeof(long))); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_2)) __PYX_ERR(0, 5, __pyx_L1_error)\r\n  __Pyx_GOTREF(__pyx_t_2);\r\n  if (PyDict_SetItem(__pyx_d, __pyx_n_s_sizeof_slong, __pyx_t_2) < 0) __PYX_ERR(0, 5, __pyx_L1_error)\r\n  __Pyx_DECREF(__pyx_t_2); __pyx_t_2 = 0;\r\n\r\n  /* \"t.pyx\":6\r\n * \r\n * sizeof_slong = sizeof(slong)\r\n * sizeof_ulong = sizeof(ulong)             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n */\r\n  __pyx_t_2 = __Pyx_PyInt_FromSize_t((sizeof(unsigned long))); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_2)) __PYX_ERR(0, 6, __pyx_L1_error)\r\n  __Pyx_GOTREF(__pyx_t_2);\r\n  if (PyDict_SetItem(__pyx_d, __pyx_n_s_sizeof_ulong, __pyx_t_2) < 0) __PYX_ERR(0, 6, __pyx_L1_error)\r\n  __Pyx_DECREF(__pyx_t_2); __pyx_t_2 = 0;\r\n```\r\nThe problem is that it should say `sizeof(slong)` and `sizeof(ulong)` but instead it says `sizeof(long)` and `sizeof(unsigned long)`.\r\n\r\nIn context this is a problem because the exact typedef for `slong` and `ulong` is determined in \"foo.h\" and may not be exactly `long` and `unsigned long`.\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Cython version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis was discussed on the mailing list:\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/g/cython-users/c/sw1D4DdJI0U/m/8sE8ySYwCgAJ",

            "body": "What's happening here: it turns out that cython considers `slong` and `ulong`  a C types (meaning \"signed long\"/\"unsigned long\") and this definition is being used before your typedef of the same name.\r\n\r\nI don't quite know why it's doing that unfortunately and whether that's a behaviour anything else relies on. We define `slong` in the Cython module so `cython.slong` should work, but it's not clear that it should be a global name for a C type.\r\n\r\nI think we should emit a warning for a typedef that conflicts with an existing builtin type. But not sure what we should go about the global definition of `slong`\r\n\r\nEither way, if you name it almost anything else, it should work. You can also use the \"cname\" feature to give it a different name in Cython than in C (if you can't modify the external typedef). The following does generate the right code.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from \"foo.h\":\r\n    ctypedef long slong_ \"slong\"\r\n\r\nsizeof_slong = sizeof(slong_)\r\n```",
