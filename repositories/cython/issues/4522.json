Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nI find that there is no wrapper for `<sys/uio.h>` in cython. After browsing the `Cython/Includes/posix` directory and [`POSIX.1-2017` basedefs](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/), I realize that many posix declarations are not wrapped in cython. For example, `<poll.h>` has not been wrapped either.\r\n\r\nAnd most of wrapped posix headers are from [`POSIX.1-2004`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/mindex.html), there are some new declarations in POSIX.1-2017 but not in POSIX.1-2004, such as `F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC` and `O_CLOEXEC` in [`<fcntl.h>`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/fcntl.h.html). \r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt is easy to add a wrapper for `<sys/uio.h>`.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# Cython/Includes/posix/uio.pxd\r\n# https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_uio.h.html\r\n\r\ncdef extern from \"<sys/uio.h>\" nogil:\r\n    cdef struct iovec:\r\n        void  *iov_base\r\n        size_t iov_len\r\n    ssize_t readv (int fd, const iovec *iov, int iovcnt)\r\n    ssize_t writev(int fd, const iovec *iov, int iovcnt)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's not the most important thing.\r\n\r\n#### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThere are two questions:\r\n\r\n 1. Should we wrap all of posix declarations? Adding the missing headers and updating the old wrappers are possile, but are they useful? For example, should we wrap `<aio.h>` or `<iconv.h>`?\r\n 2. Should we wrap some platform specific declarations? There are many of them in `posix/mman.pxd`. But maitaining many platform specific things is difficult and needs a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nIf the answer of the first question is \"yes\", we can just do it. If the answer is \"no\", how to determine which declarations should be wrapped?\r\n\r\nIf the answer of the second question is \"no\", how to deal with the existing platform specific declarations? If the answer is \"yes\", where should they be? Just in the `Includes/posix` folder? Or something like `Includes/linux` and `Includes/bsd`? If we choose the latter, the existing declarations need to be moved (they can be kept in the old places for compatibility). No matter what the answer is, it is still a problem to determine which declarations should be wrapped.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the promble is \"Which delarations are worth being wrapped?\".",
