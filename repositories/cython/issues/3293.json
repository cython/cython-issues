It probably ends up providing a lot of the functionality that people would try to use `std::optional` for, but you should view it as a feature that happens to be implemented with `std::optional` rather than a way of exposing `std::optional`.\r\n\r\nSo PRs remain welcome for a .pxd wrapper for `std::optional` - the basics should probably be fairly straight-forward to write.",
