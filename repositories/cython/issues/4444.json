Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nA coverage report misses finally block statements when you early return from the try block. That is, they are reported as not run, despite clearly being run.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n`spam.pyx`:\r\n```cython\r\n# cython: language_level=3str, linetrace=True\r\n# distutils: define_macros=CYTHON_TRACE_NOGIL=1\r\n\r\ndef spam():\r\n    try:\r\n        print(\"SPAM SPAM SPAM!!!\")\r\n        return \"SPAM\"\r\n    finally:\r\n        print(\"finally\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`main.py`:\r\n```python\r\nimport spam\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(spam.spam())\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun:\r\n```sh\r\n$ coverage run main.py\r\n$ coverage html\r\n```\r\nAnd check the generated report.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe `finally` block statements are marked as ran, but they are not.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - Python version 3.10.0\r\n - Cython version 0.29.24\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24731903/140080312-5e99e201-477b-4059-9248-a21b28030c80.png)\r\n![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24731903/140080388-3d01872d-54f9-4933-b366-868a018c7d68.png)\r\n\r\n",
