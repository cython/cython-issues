    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nI would like to add Cython to a package of mine, but Cython would be highly optional using the Pure Python mode. The issue is that I would like to avoid having users install the huge 26 MB transpiler that Cython has become - compared to the 15 KBs that the Shadow.py file takes up!\r\n\r\n## Preferred Solution\r\n\r\nThe best solution for my case would be a separate `cython-shadow` package which would trigger when trying to import `Cython` (or `cython`) like it does right now.\r\n\r\nThat would allow me to have the main package `Cython` as a development dependency and my package would be compiled if Cython is present, but would fall onto the much smaller *required* dependency consisting only of the shadow code.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nIf this can't be done I would be forced to somehow vendor in this fallback (if even possible) or publish this myself as a fork.",
