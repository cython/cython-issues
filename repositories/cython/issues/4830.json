    "body": "One of the things I like to do when declare c function prototypes in a `cdef extern from <header>` is to include, as a comment, a line a of documentation for each function.\r\n\r\nMay I suggest that cython allow for docstrings as an alternative for comments in such cases. \r\n\r\nSo for example, from one of my projects:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from \"ext_dictobj.h\":\r\n\r\n    cdef t_dictionary *dictobj_register(t_dictionary *d, t_symbol **name)\r\n        # Register a t_dictionary with the dictionary passing system and map it to a unique name.\r\n\r\n    # would have as an alternative (with the colon)\r\n\r\n    cdef t_dictionary *dictobj_register(t_dictionary *d, t_symbol **name):\r\n        \"\"\"Register a t_dictionary with the dictionary passing system and map it to a unique name.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    # or (without the colon)\r\n\r\n    cdef t_dictionary *dictobj_register(t_dictionary *d, t_symbol **name)\r\n        \"\"\"Register a t_dictionary with the dictionary passing system and map it to a unique name.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this enhancement has the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Consistency with python code\r\n2. Improved code highlighting in editors\r\n3. Can help with auto-generated documentation of cython declarations\r\n\r\nA possible disadvantage may be that it would complicate or slow down parsing of such declarations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
