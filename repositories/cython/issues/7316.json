Please describe.\n\nAs we are all know we often should write some helper or factory methods to convert some types in Cython, but we also should use then it with syntax like `MyType_from_OtherType(some_var)`. \n \nIt would be cool to add special decorators or dunder methods to register custom function for types conversion, and then to be able to use much more readable `<OtherType>(some_Var)` syntax for that.\n\nWe already have definitions in generated code like\n```C\n__Pyx_PyFloat_AsDouble\n// means\nPyAPI_FUNC(double) PyFloat_AsDouble(PyObject*);\n```\nWhich allows to us `<double>100`, so give us a possibility to customize it\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI would like to use something like that in Cython to define/declare factory functions to convert data between different types, especially between Python classes and C/C++ structs/classes \n\n```cython\ncdef struct MyStruct:\n    double a\n    int b\n\ncdef class MyClass:\n    pass\n    \n@cython.convertor\ncdef MyStruct MyClass_AsMyStruct(object my_obj):\n    cdef MyStruct ret\n    # There the conversion logic\n    return ret\n\n@cython.convertor\ncdef object MyStruct_AsMyClass(MyStruct *my_struct):\n    cdef object obj\n    # There the conversion logic\n    return obj\n```   \n\nThen It would be nice to convert between declared types with this syntax\n```cython\ncdef object my_obj = MyClass()\ncdef MyStruct my_struct = <MyStruct>(my_obj)\ncdef object my_obj2 = <MyClass>(&my_struct)\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nOther approach is allow to use special dunder methods but this can be less flexible than decorators, decorators should allow to register convertations for any types \n```cython\ncdef class MyClass:\n\n    cdef MyStruct __AsMyStruct(self):\n        # There the conversion logic\n        return MyStruct(...)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    cdef object __FromMyStruct(MyStruct *my_struct):\n        # There the conversion logic\n        return MyClass(...)\n```\n\nYou can propose any other method to register custom types convertors, but using `<type>var` syntax looks much clear and readable and native for cython\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
