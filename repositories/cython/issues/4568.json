    "body": "@scoder @matusvalo [This change](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4498) killed some nasty dynamic `build_ext` subclassing that PyYAML's been doing since the dawn of time (see https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/601 and https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/blob/6.0/setup.py#L174-L238). The most immediate issue is just that the `cython_sources` method from `old_build_ext` that PyYAML's subclass was calling is no longer available- I tried a few different ways of patching it on with no success (various issues around missing instance data on either the command or the extension by the time `get_source_files` is called). \r\n\r\nA couple of questions:\r\n1) Would you consider a reasonably simple change to emulate the `cython_sources` method from `old_build_ext` (to keep already-released PyYAML `build_ext` subclasses working on 3.0.0a10+ without modification)? That's assuming I can come up with one- so far, that's not looking good...\r\n2) Curious what the long-term plan is for `old_build_ext`? I can make things work again in future PyYAML releases without rewiring all the ancient build code just by swapping in `old_build_ext` (eg https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/602), but not sure how long it'll be around.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(I can open an issue for this, but if the answers to the above are \"no\" and \"not very long\", not much point :wink: )\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nitzmahone in https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4498#issuecomment-1011573018_",

The way that function is being used in PyYAML seems to intend replacing the .pyx sources by the generated .c sources. If that's it, then calling `cythonize()` instead might work. Not even sure if you need to inherit from Cython's `build_ext` in that case at all (or could simply use the one from setuptools).\r\n\r\n\r\n>     1.

That's assuming I can come up with one- so far, that's not looking good...\r\n\r\nIf it's just about calling `cythonize()`, then it's probably ok for us to re-add that to keep it working.\r\n\r\n\r\n>     2. Curious what the long-term plan is for `old_build_ext`? I can make things work again in future PyYAML releases without rewiring all the ancient build code just by swapping in `old_build_ext` (eg [WIP keep PyYAML build working on Cython3.0.0a10+ yaml/pyyaml#602](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/602)), but not sure how long it'll be around.\r\n\r\nIt's an annoying piece of outdated and duplicated code, not very well tested, and thus likely to break silently at some point. In terms of project management, that probably means that it will stick around forever, but not necessarily in a usable state for very long.",
