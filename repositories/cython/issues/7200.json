In free-threading the dict pointer is stored atomically as such it will lead to data races when dict is changed concurrently on the object. \n\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/c00a9c97812b4536c2016751697e06f74801e26b/Cython/Utility/ObjectHandling.c#L1729\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNo data races \n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.14\n\n### Cython version\n\nmain\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee `_PyObject_SetManagedDict` in CPython for the use of atomic for setting the dict.
