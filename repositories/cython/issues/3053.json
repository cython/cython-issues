    "body": "Hi, using cython 0.28.5 I encounter the following situation.\r\n\r\nSay I have the following two routines inside the file test.pyx\r\n\r\n```\r\ncpdef test1(int[:, ::1] array):\r\n   test2(array[4:8, 5:9])\r\n\r\ncdef test2(int[:, ::1] array):\r\n   pass array to a method in c++ that expects array to be C-contiguous\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen I pass a numpy array directly from python to test1 that is not contiguous then an error is raised. However when I pass an non-contiguous memoryview to a method then no error is raised and the execution continues. I don't know if this is an actual bug or a \"feature\". \r\nI couldn't find any guidelines in the documentation and my guess is that this is an actual bug because not raising an error in the function test2 might lead to very nasty bugs when passing the buffer to other languages that expect the buffer to be continuous. Thanks.",
