Please describe.\n\nSuppose I try to implement a function like\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef const int f():\r\n    return 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCython will generate code like\r\n```c\r\nstatic int const __pyx_f_10constrepro_f(void) {\r\n  int const __pyx_r;\r\n  __Pyx_RefNannyDeclarations\r\n  __Pyx_RefNannySetupContext(\"f\", 0);\r\n\r\n  __pyx_r = 1;\r\n  goto __pyx_L0;\r\n\r\n  /* function exit code */\r\n  __pyx_L0:;\r\n  __Pyx_RefNannyFinishContext();\r\n  return __pyx_r;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the return value was declared like `int const __pyx_r;`, `__pyx_r = 1;` is not valid.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI would like\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef const int f():\r\n    return 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nto generate valid code.\r\n\r\nI believe this could be accomplished by stripping const qualifiers from the declaration of the return variable, generating code like\r\n\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic int const __pyx_f_10constrepro_f(void) {\r\n  int __pyx_r; // but the function return type is still `int const`\r\n  ...\r\n  __pyx_r = 1;\r\n  ...\r\n  return __pyx_r;\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
