    "body": "There's a `generate_pxi` option that looks to have been imported from Pyrex 15 years ago. Some details:\r\n* It looks to have been basically unmodified since then.\r\n* It has some supporting infrastructure (`PyrexCodeGenerator`) that kind of duplicates other existing infrastructure (`PyxCodeGenerator`) but with very slight differences, and is otherwise unused.\r\n* It's not covered by any tests,\r\n* It was discussed in #1866 as being close to a more modern/useful unimplemented feature (and so that might be a good reason to keep it, if it could be repurposed into something more useful).\r\n\r\nSo the question is: does anyone actually make use of this for anything or is this a candidate to be removed?",
