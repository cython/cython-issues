I am open to feedback or correction, and thank you for your consideration.",

There's no obvious link with anything to do with your C ABI incompatibilities.\n\n> May 16, 2025: Cython issued hotfixes ([cython/compare/3.1.0-1...master](https://github.com/cython/cython/compare/3.1.0-1...master)) for compiler warnings in Python 3.13 builds, including unreachable code and unused parameter errors. These surfaced due to stricter warning enforcement (e.g., -Werror=unused-parameter) and shifting assumptions about compiler behavior.\n\nWe generally try to keep our output as free of warnings as possible.  You can probably find at least 10 commits a year on Cython to reduce compiler warnings. These warnings surfaced because we recently released a new version and people began testing it more thoroughly. I don't know what this has to do with your timeline.\n\n> https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Regression-in-17120:-Substitution-Fail/10792624\n\nThat's nothing to do with ABIs.

However, the emergence of suppression measures and typing silencing across NumPy, Cython, and toolchain commits still suggests a shared ecosystem response to pressure from evolving compiler behaviors (GCC 15.1, C23, Python 3.13).\n\nI never intended to say each commit was caused by a single root vulnerability. Rather, the pattern of commit behavior, runtime bypasses, reversed deprecations, increased silence of static tools, reflects a systemic adaptation to deeper compiler shifts that affect ABI trust, memory layout, and CI expectations.\n\nIf even one part of the pipeline has moved, others must react to maintain build stability. That's the phenomenon I'm trying to document.",
