            "body": "> Not quite following what you mean by cython.numpy.\r\n\r\nThis part is actually pertinent to the original topic.  `cython.numpy` was an example, the idea being that it would basically just implement `__dir__` to make it easy for beginners to figure out from the interpreter what can be `cimport`ed.\r\n\r\nWith things like `np.get_include()` it can be non-obvious what is available in the namespace, and errors can pass silently.\r\n\r\nAn example of a silent namespace error: For quite a while I had a branch of [datetime.pxd](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/src/datetime.pxd) where I tried to extern-import \"get_datetimestruct_days\" as:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from \"numpy/ndarrayobject.h\":\r\n    npy_int64 get_datetimestruct_days(const npy_datetimestruct *dts)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... a name which I now know is not exported in that namespace (are \"exported\" and \"namespace\" the right terminology here?  Let me know if the meaning is not clear).  It did not cause an error because the same function _was_ exported by pandas' src/datetime/np_datetime.h, and while I still had a `cdef extern from \"datetime/np_datetime.h\":` block (even though `get_datetimestruct_days` was not referenced in this block).\r\n\r\nTo recap the original issue: it would be awesome to have a python-facing way of grokking namespaces.  I'll offer labor if there's an interest in making this happen.",
