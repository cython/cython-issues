    "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nA issue I hit with ` annotation_typing` and it defaults (True) is that it enforces strict typing checks on the inputs.\n\nIn some cases, I prefer to have a custom error message, and thus do my type checking at the beginning of my functions. In some case I may also accept a legacy type, that I do not want to appear in the typing hints.\n\nThis can be achieved easily by setting `annotation_typing` to False, or by not typing the input.\n\nIn a second phase, I generate a stub pyi file out of my compiled library. To do so, I inspect the annotations of the functions.\n\nThe issue raised in this Enhancement report is that there doesn't seem to be a way to say 'do not check the inputs for me' while still having 'include annotation information for the inspect module'. Indeed `annotation_typing` set to False seems to behave exactly as not having typing information at all: the typing information is not available either to the inspect module.\n\nI argue there should be a way to disable the typing enforcement, while having typing information included in the function definition (inspect module). To me `annotation_typing` set to False should have this behaviour.\n\nMy current workaround is to have manual rules and hand definitions for the corner cases...\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n`annotation_typing` set to False still includes typing information for the inspect module.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nHaving a new compile option. However I think it makes more sense to keep typing information with `annotation_typing` set to False. Why would the programmer write typing information if it is for it to not be used at all.\n\n### Additional context\n\nMy current stub generator:\nhttps://github.com/DearCyGui/DearCyGui/blob/21fc3ac23297d046ecbc8b4330e06873c58ce1b8/stubs/stub_generator.py",
