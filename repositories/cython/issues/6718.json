More specifically, when the tests for `skimage.graph` are ran, the following traceback is shown in gdb:\n\n```\n#0  0x000055b2571f2504 in __tsan_atomic32_load ()\n#1  0x00007f73497f845f in _Py_atomic_load_uint32_relaxed (obj=0xc) at ./Include/cpython/pyatomic_gcc.h:339\n#2  Py_INCREF (op=0x0) at ./Include/object.h:810\n#3  _Py_NewRef (obj=0x0) at ./Include/object.h:1058\n#4  _PyFunction_FromConstructor (constr=constr@entry=0x7ffdde22c348) at Objects/funcobject.c:116\n#5  0x00007f73497f2bf5 in PyFrame_New (tstate=0x7f7349da8e30 <_PyRuntime+310448>, code=0x7f73101e00e0, globals=<optimized out>, locals=0x0)\n    at Objects/frameobject.c:1920\n#6  0x00007f72fad56118 in __Pyx_AddTraceback (funcname=0x7f72fadf2c5a \"View.MemoryView._err_dim\", c_line=0, py_line=1253, \n    filename=0x7f72fadedda5 \"<stringsource>\") at skimage/graph/_mcp.cpython-313t-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.p/_mcp.c:44128\n#7  0x00007f72fadc028c in __pyx_memoryview_err_dim (__pyx_v_error=0x7f7349d2d598 <_PyExc_IndexError>, __pyx_v_msg=0x7f7309b15700, \n    __pyx_v_dim=0) at skimage/graph/_mcp.cpython-313t-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.p/_mcp.c:16458\n#8  0x00007f72fadc7337 in __pyx_memoryview_slice_memviewslice (__pyx_v_dst=0x7ffdde22cac8, __pyx_v_shape=3, __pyx_v_stride=1, \n    __pyx_v_suboffset=-1, __pyx_v_dim=0, __pyx_v_new_ndim=0, __pyx_v_suboffset_dim=0x7ffdde22cc70, __pyx_v_start=3, __pyx_v_stop=0, \n    __pyx_v_step=0, __pyx_v_have_start=0, __pyx_v_have_stop=0, __pyx_v_have_step=0, __pyx_v_is_slice=0)\n    at skimage/graph/_mcp.cpython-313t-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.p/_mcp.c:12972\n#9  0x00007f72fadc5bda in __pyx_memview_slice (__pyx_v_memview=0x7f730b102d80, __pyx_v_indices=0x7f730a8f7cc0)\n    at skimage/graph/_mcp.cpython-313t-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.p/_mcp.c:12574\n```\n\nWhich in turn calls `PyFrame_New`, defined in the CPython API:\n\n```\n#6  0x00007f72fad56118 in __Pyx_AddTraceback (funcname=0x7f72fadf2c5a \"View.MemoryView._err_dim\", c_line=0, py_line=1253, \n    filename=0x7f72fadedda5 \"<stringsource>\") at skimage/graph/_mcp.cpython-313t-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.p/_mcp.c:44128\n44128\t    py_frame = PyFrame_New(\n(gdb) l\n44123\t            goto bad;\n44124\t        }\n44125\t        __Pyx_ErrRestoreInState(tstate, ptype, pvalue, ptraceback);\n44126\t        __pyx_insert_code_object(c_line ? -c_line : py_line, py_code);\n44127\t    }\n44128\t    py_frame = PyFrame_New(\n44129\t        tstate,            /*PyThreadState *tstate,*/\n44130\t        py_code,           /*PyCodeObject *code,*/\n44131\t        __pyx_mstate_global->__pyx_d,    /*PyObject *globals,*/\n44132\t        0                  /*PyObject *locals*/\n```\n\nI haven't been able to produce a small reproducing snippet, however, after inspecting the CPython issue tracker, it seems that frame handling is not thread-safe, c.f., https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118680 and https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128421.

And building it in the sanitized version of Python was sufficiently slow that I couldn't really iterate.\n\nMy guess is that the issue is more like in Cython than Python - PyFrame_New looks fairly simple, and the thread-safety issues reported with tracebacks on Python don't really look relevant.  The code object cache seems the most likely thing to be suspicious of but I can't see any obvious issues.\n\nThe code object cache can be turned off by setting the C macro `CYTHON_ATOMICS=0`. That'll also affect memoryviews though and is probably largely untested (no modern compiler will default to it). But if that solved the problem then it really would point to the code object cache.\n\nBeyond that, it'll have to wait until I've got time to try to get a working scikit-image",
