    "body": "Sorry if this is more like a support request than a real issue, but I haven't been able to find the best practice in the documentation. What is the best way to allocate a variable size array in \"pure c/cython\"?\r\nI have found in the documentation the possibility to use e.g., `np.empty`. But in my case, the function is used in a tight loop and the overhead seems quite high. \r\n \r\nHere the sample: A simple function that takes a memory view of a 2D numpy array and returns the `k-th` diagonal.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# cython: language_level=3\r\n# cython: infer_types=True\r\n# cython: profile=True\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\nDTYPE_INT = np.intc\r\n\r\n@cython.boundscheck(False)\r\n@cython.wraparound(False)\r\n@cython.nonecheck(False)\r\ncdef int[:] npdiag(int[:,:] arr, int k=0):\r\n    rows = arr.shape[0]\r\n    cols = arr.shape[1]\r\n    if k < 0:\r\n        rows = rows + k\r\n    if k > 0:\r\n        cols = cols - k\r\n    cdef int n = max(min(rows, cols), 0)\r\n    cdef int[:] ret = np.empty(n, dtype=DTYPE_INT)  # slow and \"dark yellow\" in the annotated html\r\n    if k >= 0:\r\n        for i in range(n):\r\n            ret[i] = arr[i, k + i]\r\n    else:\r\n        for i in range(n):\r\n            ret[i] = arr[i - k, i]\r\n    return ret\r\n```\r\n\r\nthanks",
