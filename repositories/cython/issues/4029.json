It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPEP 634 defines a new \"switch-statement-like syntax\": https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/ that will appear in Python 3.10. Being a Python language feature, Cython should aim to support this.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n* Probably not worth supporting until after the release of Python 3.10 (in principle it could change before then).\r\n* Probably a fairly complicated feature to implement (involves both parser and code generation changes)\r\n* If https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3400 is merged by then, it'll need to generate `__match_args__` (this can be implemented separately from the language support though)\r\n",
