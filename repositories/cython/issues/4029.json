If you look at the byte-code for a function that uses pattern matching, it's mostly broken down into a set of comparisons. E.g. `case (a, b)` gets split into:\r\n\r\n```\r\n              8 GET_LEN\r\n             10 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)\r\n             12 COMPARE_OP               2 (==)\r\n             14 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       18 (to 36)\r\n             16 UNPACK_SEQUENCE          2\r\n             18 STORE_FAST               1 (a)\r\n             20 STORE_FAST               2 (b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think it's mostly a parsing then AST manipulation issue.\r\n\r\nIt can probably be split into a parsing PR, and then successive PRs to make individual types of patterns work successfully.
