There seem to be two core issues:\r\n - `__cinit__` in the `tp_new`. Interplay between `__cinit__` and `__new__` would have to be defined somehow. What happens when both are defined, etc.?\r\n -  There is also a mention of the __new__ return type here: https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/746627fdca5e48db2b63c8bb4be82b33ea617549/Cython/Compiler/ExprNodes.py#L5953-L5958\r\n   With support for `__new__` that can return an arbitrary subclass this would need to be resolved I guess.",

We put a function there that invokes the (`tp_new`) allocation function of the base class and then calls its own `__cinit__` on the object when coming back. That can still be done with a custom `__new__`, but it would mean that if `__new__` returns an object of a different class, there would be a different allocation chain with (possibly) their own entirely different `__cinit__` functions to be called that would be part of the allocation chain *invoked by* `__new__`, not the chain that *called* `__new__`.\r\n\r\nThere are different use cases to be looked at here, mainly:\r\n\r\nReturn an unrelated object, e.g.\r\n```python\r\nclass C:\r\n    def __new__(cls):\r\n        return {}\r\n```\r\nThere's nothing to do in this case, just invoke the user `__new__` method from `tp_new` and return the resulting object.\r\n\r\nWe can also return a related object from the hierarchy, e.g.\r\n```python\r\nclass _Base:\r\n    def __new__(cls):\r\n        c = create_new_instance_of(cls)\r\n        c.initialised = True\r\n        return c\r\n\r\nclass Subclass(_Base):\r\n    …\r\n\r\ns = Subclass()\r\n```\r\nAnd this is where it becomes tricky. How do you do `create_new_instance_of(cls)`? Is that `object.__new__(cls)`? That can't be implemented as `object.tp_new(cls)` because that wouldn't be sufficient to initialise the object. It would still need to call `Subclass.tp_new()` and the entire call chain, but bypass `Base.__new__()`. So, `__new__` is actually not `tp_new`, semantically. `tp_new` is what should be called in the very end, by `object.__new__(cls)`, including the complete call chain of the class and all of its `__cinit__` methods.\r\n\r\nI think it becomes easier to understand if it we consider `__new__` and `tp_new` unrelated features.",
