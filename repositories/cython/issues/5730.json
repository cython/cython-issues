    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nCython includes [a shortcut to use C/C++ bool](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Includes/libcpp/__init__.pxd). However, this does not add an include for stdbool.h. This works fine if you compile the resulting code as C++ or C23, however if the code is compiled as an older C version, it will fail due to bool being undefined (and there is no libc/stdbool.pyx as a C alternative).\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\nfrom libcpp cimport bool\r\n\r\n\r\ncdef f1(bool x):\r\n\tpass\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompile resulting C code as C99 or C11.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nFor the code to compile as older C versions, stdbool.h needs to be included (on C++ and C23, it's a noop).\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.9.18\n\n### Cython version\n\n0.29.34\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
