Please describe.\r\n\r\nTo use openmp with cython one needs to add specific compile flags as described here:\r\nhttps://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/parallelism.html#compiling\r\n\r\nTo be able to do that with different compilers/os ,one needs to implement some logic to determine the correct flags.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nThe [extension-helpers](https://github.com/astropy/extension-helpers/) module for astropy does exactly that.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a nice feature to have some helper functions directly in cython to use in a `setup.py` like done here:\r\nhttps://extension-helpers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openmp.html\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI usually use an environment variable to determine if the compilation should use openmp or not:\r\nhttps://github.com/GeoStat-Framework/GSTools/blob/f60f2cb9e72593a774ea2c2118ecbdb39c566165/setup.py#L20\r\n\r\nMostly due to the fact that wheels shouldn't include openmp libraries, so they should not be compiled with openmp support by default.",
