Please describe.\r\n\r\nTo use openmp with cython one needs to add specific compile flags as described here:\r\nhttps://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/parallelism.html#compiling\r\n\r\nTo be able to do that with different compilers/os ,one needs to implement some logic to determine the correct flags.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nThe [extension-helpers](https://github.com/astropy/extension-helpers/) module for astropy does exactly that.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a nice feature to have some helper functions directly in cython to use in a `setup.py` like done here:\r\nhttps://extension-helpers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openmp.html\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI usually use an environment variable to determine if the compilation should use openmp or not:\r\nhttps://github.com/GeoStat-Framework/GSTools/blob/f60f2cb9e72593a774ea2c2118ecbdb39c566165/setup.py#L20\r\n\r\nMostly due to the fact that wheels shouldn't include openmp libraries, so they should not be compiled with openmp support by default.",

I'm not sure what else you'd want here.\r\n\r\nNote that you can pass `Extension` objects into `cythonize()`, so, just use `get_extensions()` or some other way to create the `Extension` objects, then pass them into `cythonize()`, then pass the result through `add_openmp_flags_if_available()`. Or maybe reverse the last two, I haven't actually tested it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't see why Cython should replicate existing functionality here that seems easy enough for users to integrate on their side.",
