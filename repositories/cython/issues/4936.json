    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nExponentiation is common in scientific code. Currently, the way that Cython processes exponentiation is to have the result type match the operand type. This issue has been brought up many times before (see  #2133 for example). This can be surprise to those who choose to compile their code to gain a speed boost, even in Pure Python mode. For example:\r\n```python\r\ndef sqrt(x: double):\r\n  return x ** 0.5\r\nprint(sqrt(-1)) # -> Prints (6.123233995736766e-17+1j) with Python (3.10.5), and nan with Cython (3.0.0a10 on Windows)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, this issue have been closed before, but the recommended remedy (which is to add documentation to the Caveats page) has not been done\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nPersonally, I would like Cython to compile Pure Python code to match Python semantics as much as reasonable, and I think, since Cython 3 is open to breaking changes, that following Python semantics for exponentiation should be the default action moving forward.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative that I am also happy is to keep the current semantics, but to provide a note in the \"Caveats\" section of the documentation, in addition to providing a clear compile-time warning whenever the Cython compiler can not guarantee adherence to Python exponentiation semantics.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI am willing to make a PR to the Caveats documentation if that is the route the core Cython devs want to go. But, as an aside, my current PR for documentation on `__cinit__` has yet to be approved.",

            "body": "Phew, this seems difficult to argue with these days. The intention of Cython language semantics is \"Python by default, unless you opt out into C\". In your example, you kind of opt out into C via typing as `double`, but we also require `@cython.cdivision`, so why not require an `@cython.cpow` as well?\r\n\r\nWe infer Python `float` as C `double` when possible, so having such a semantic difference between the two would render that hard to understand for users. However, `**` could be considered an unsafe operation for C `double`, which would change the inference to apply Python semantics and return a Python `float`, unless `@cpow` is enabled. (IIRC, we only do that for integers currently and not for floats.)\r\n\r\nI agree that Cython 3.0 is the right time to change this.",

We are lucky that division _always_ goes to floats in Python, so that's different. The power operator is definitely more complex to deal with (we'll keep running into that pun, I guess).\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the difference between these:\r\n```python\r\n# values from somewhere\r\nbase: cython.double = 1234.5\r\nexp: cython.double = 2.0\r\n\r\nv1 = 1234.5 ** 2.0\r\nv2 = base ** 2.0\r\n\r\nv3 = 1234.5 ** exp\r\nv4 = base ** exp\r\n```\r\nIn the first two cases, it's clear that the result is always a C double, whereas in the expressions with variable exponents, we'd have to handle the complex result case, although the values are exactly the same. That's something that I really dislike about this change. Imagine users moving an exponent into a global C constant for clarity, and getting totally different C code from it.\r\n\r\nI'm still not entirely convinced that this is something we _should_ change in Cython. We had cases in the past where we decided for Python correctness even (somewhat) against practicality. But deciding that would need more user input. Maybe something to ask on cython-users.",

This means\r\n         that Cython has to add checks to handle this possibility, which will make the code less efficient.\r\n         - If the exponent will never be a non-integer, use an integer type or cast to it\r\n         - If the base will never be negative, do <this>\r\n         - Use types (or constants) that make it possible to infer that the result will never be complex\r\n         - If complex results need to be handled, silence this warning by using cpow\r\n```\r\n\r\nPossible candidates for:\r\n* `<this>`: add `abs()` around the base? [Idea](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4936#issuecomment-1242924387) by @0dminnimda \r\n  * previously: add `assert base >= 0` before -> would require a big new feature (\"optimizations based on asserts\")\r\n\r\nNot sure how hard it would be to do it, but I think it would be a nice usability improvement. Exponentiation is definitely not a rare task IMO, quite the opposite (e.g. calculating distances/approximations for almost anything + moments, integration, power series, etc. etc. etc.).",
