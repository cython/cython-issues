I agree the documentation would make most sense the way you suggest. \r\n\r\n> Alternatively, if we require ufuncs to be cfuncs anyway, we can also consider `@ufunc` to imply `@cfunc`.  But we should only do that if we are certain that we won't ever allow Python functions here.\r\n\r\nI'm actually leaning to a different interpretation:\r\n\r\nThe `@ufunc` decorator produces a callable Python object (so the user-visible bit of `myufunc` isn't really a `cfunc`). Internally it's based on a `cfunc` but that's an implementation detail. Therefore I think we should allow `ufunc` on its own, and don't *require* it to be combined with `cfunc`.\r\n\r\nCurrently we impose restrictions of the callable it wraps that are the same as the restrictions for a `cfunc`. But that doesn't quite mean it \"is a cfunc\".\r\n\r\n(As an aside, one thing I'm wondering about for generalized ufuncs is separating input and output arguments with `*` rather than returning them e.g. `def f(double[:] input1, double input2, *, double[:] output1):`. To implement that it'd be convenient to at least get it through the parser as a regular function. But that's currently just a thought).",
