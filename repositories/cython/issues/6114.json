    "body": "I ran into a couple of problems today that I was able to trace back to this PR. I was able to fix both of them, and I wasn't sure whether to open issues because I strongly suspect that they're simply unsupported use cases that happened to work previously and are better caught after the changes in this PR, so I thought I'd ask here first rather than opening an issue. Apologies if that's not your preferred approach, I wasn't sure what would be easier for you.\r\n\r\nThe first problem came from code that was declaring C++ template APIs in a pxd file as explicit template instantiations rather than as templates, i.e. roughly this\r\n```\r\nfrom libcpp.memory cimport unique_ptr\r\ncdef extern from *:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    #include <memory>\r\n\r\n    template <typename T>\r\n    class myclass {};\r\n\r\n    template <typename T>\r\n    void std::unique_ptr<myclass<T>> f() {}\r\n\r\n    template class myclass<T>;\r\n    template std::unique_ptr<myclass<T>>\r\n    \"\"\"\"\r\n    cdef cppclass myclass[T]:\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    cdef unique_ptr[myclass[int]] f[int]() # Note the explicit `int` instead of `T` here\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's something more to it than just that since this MRE compiles for me, but changing the function declaration to use a template typename instead of a real type fixed compilation, and I've never seen the real type used there before, so I don't even know if this was intended to work.\r\n\r\nThe second problem came from a case where some code was shadowing a (non-templated) C function with a template C++ function:\r\n```\r\nfrom libc.stdlib cimport free\r\n\r\ncdef extern from *:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    template <typename T>\r\n    void free(...) {}\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    cdef void free[T](...)\r\n\r\nfree[int](...)  # This used to work, but started throwing errors after this PR.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wouldn't expect this to be valid Cython either, but apparently it worked before.\r\n\r\nDo either of these changes appear to merit any follow-up to you? If so, I'm happy to open up an issue or two with proper MREs, but I wasn't sure if that was worthwhile here. Thanks!\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @vyasr in https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3235#issuecomment-2024105616_\r\n            ",

            "body": "The second one:\r\n\r\nWhat's happening is that previously the templated `free` completely overrode the non-templated `free` I think. Therefore explicitly indexing it worked fine. It's now trying to explicitly index the non-templated free.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution is to go through the available alternatives when indexing and pick one with a matching number of templates. That seems to work fine and is probably no worse than what we had before.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's splitting the \"find the right alternative\" method into two parts - a simple one that applies to explicitly indexed  template functions (and requires a single exact match) and a more complicated one that applies to non-index functions.\r\n\r\nWill try to decide how complicated it's worth making this...",
