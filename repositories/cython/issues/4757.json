It aims to add some typing decorators to help type checkers understand that something is \"dataclass-like\" or \"field-like\". Cython's dataclasses are designed to look as much like Python dataclasses as possible (but obviously not perfect).\r\n\r\nWe should work out (probably from people who use type-checkers, which isn't me...) whether Cython could use PEP 681 to help type checkers understand Cython dataclasses. I guess this involves changes in \"shadow.py\" (if anything).\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that it genuinely isn't needed (type checkers might be looking at the compiled Cython module rather than the source code, so perhaps it doesn't help).",
