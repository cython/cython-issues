The macros are empty `#define`s now in Python3.4+, so any functions wrapped in them are not actually being exported/imported (unless used with Python2). Doing `git grep DL_EXPORT` shows usage in \r\n```\r\nCython/Compiler/ModuleNode.py\r\nCython/Compiler/PyrexTypes.py\r\nCython/Utility/ModuleSetupCode.c\r\nDemos/embed/Makefile.msc  # documentation?\r\ntests/compile/callingconvention.srctree\r\ntests/compile/declarations.srctree\r\ntests/compile/excvalcheck.h\r\ntests/compile/nogil.h\r\n```\r\nIt seems that the code paths in Cython that define `DL_EXPORT` and `DL_IMPORT` do not actually expect them to do anything? If that is correct, should we remove them?\r\n",
