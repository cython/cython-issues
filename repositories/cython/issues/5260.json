The solution I've used for `ufunc` or returning the type (or a ctuple) won't work or will require a lot of unnecessary allocation. I'd probably be easier to pass in the parameters to be outputted:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef void f(double [:] x, double y, double [:] out_1, double *out_2):\r\n```\r\n(in this version I'm considering treating all parameters with a name starting with `out` as output parameters. Note that scalars outputs need to be pointers).\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef void g(double [:] x, double y, *, double[:] ret1, double *ret2):\r\n```\r\n(this version proposes using `*` to separate input and output parameters, which would require a parser change)\r\n\r\nI haven't got a good solution for this yet, and none of the solutions really handle scalar pyobjects.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

This would be a required argument passed to a dedicated gufunc decorator, or perhaps the presence or absence of the signature would tell Cython whether to generate a standard UFunc or a generalized UFunc.

            "body": "Hey @da-woods, @DWesl,\nI have given implementing a `@cython.gufunc` decorator a shot. See https://github.com/jan-david-fischbach/cython/tree/gufunc-decorator\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> As the cython codebase is rather large (and I am fairly unfamiliar with it) I used copilot to help me with some aspects - in particular \n> 1. handling named dimensions in the signatures\n> 2. extending the pyx templates to handle passing pointers etc.\n> 3. increasing test coverage for named dimensions\n> 4. and more\n> I have thoroughly checked all suggestions.\n\n## Conceptual Details\nAs sugested by @DWesl I based the implementation largely on specifying the function signature for example as:\n```python\n@cython.gufunc(\"(m,n),(n,p)->(m,p)\")\n```\nfor a matrix matrix product. In the function signature the arguments are ordered as `(*input, *output, *named_dimensions)`.\n- Inputs are passed in as scalars for \"()\" and as pointers for array-valued arguments e.g. \"(m,n)\"\n- Outputs are always passed as pointers to make a unified way of retrieval possible. To return a scalar one has to assign `out[0]=scalar`. Multiple outputs are permitted\n- If the signature contains named dimensions `numpy` provides the size of these at runtime. They are passed to the decorated function in the order in which they first appear. I.e. for the signature above it would be `cnp.npy_intp m, cnp.npy_intp n, cnp.npy_intp p`.\n\nAt compile time it is asserted, that the number of arguments the decorated function expects conforms to the expected number of arguments based on the given signature.\n\nIn summary an example function could look like this:\n``` python\n@cython.gufunc(\"(m,n),(n,p)->(m,p)\")\ncdef void matmat(double* a, double* b, double* out, cnp.npy_intp m, cnp.npy_intp n, cnp.npy_intp p):\n    \"\"\"Matrix-matrix multiplication\"\"\"\n    cdef cnp.npy_intp ii, jj, kk\n    # Initialize output\n    for ii in range(m):\n        for jj in range(p):\n            out[ii * p + jj] = 0\n    # Compute matrix multiplication\n    for ii in range(m):\n        for jj in range(p):\n            for kk in range(n):\n                out[ii * p + jj] += a[ii * n + kk] * b[kk * p + jj]\n```\n\nsee `tests/run/gufunc.pyx` for more examples.\n\n## Difference to `@cython.ufunc`\nWhen all arguments and outputs in the signature are scalar - i.e. `ufuncs` are in principle sufficient - the `@cython.gufunc` syntax still has some notable differences to the `@cython.ufunc` syntax. Particularly as outputs are not directly returned, but rather passed in as pointers:\n\n```python\n@cython.gufunc(\"(),()->()\")\ncdef void args_int(int a1, int a2, int* out):\n    out[0] = a1 + a2\n```\nvs.\n```python\n@cython.ufunc\ncdef void args_int(int a1, int a2):\n    return a1 + a2\n```\n\n## Possible improvements\n- *Type-checking* the arguments corresponding to named dimensions\n- Cast pointers to appropriately shaped arrays instead -> would avoid having to manually keep track where to put things like `out[ii * p + jj] += a[ii * n + kk] * b[kk * p + jj]`\n\n",

I don't think your version does this either because we don't allow a pointer to `object`. I don't think there's a nice solution though, so I don't think it's a problem that needs solving here. It's also a limitation of `ufunc` with multiple return values.\n\nI think the bigger issue with your implementation is that it assumes that all the arrays are C contiguous and that isn't generally true.\n(At least I can't see any tests for it, and I think the wrapped function would have to know the steps to work).\nObvious it would be possible to add the steps to the signature too although using them to do the manual calculation of where to write would be a bit nasty.\n\nTo me that suggests that it would be better to have a function taking typed memoryviews for array arguments. That'd probably lose a little bit of performance over the raw pointer version, but it'd be much more usable.\n\n-----------\n\n(thanks for the AI disclosure - I think it is better to put these things up front)\n",

There we previously also used pointer magic to define the gufuncs. \n\nThe problem: introducing the gufunc decorator instead of the boilerplate is seen as a \"cosmetic\" change, that should not negatively impact performance. Maybe we could provide both options, inferring from the signature of the wrapped function whether it accepts typed memory views or pointers?",
