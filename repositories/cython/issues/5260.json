The idea is that arrays of different dimensionality can be combined in predictable ways. For example a function might reduce a 1D array and a scalar to a scalar (and then Numpy would allow this to work automatically on a 2D array and a 1D array\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n@ufunc(...) # possible some extra info needs to go here\r\ncdef double f(double[:] x, double y):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nWe could extend the infrastructure that exists for standard ufuncs to support this too.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nThe tricky bit of this is handling cases where the *output* array is multi-dimensional. The solution I've used for `ufunc` or returning the type (or a ctuple) won't work or will require a lot of unnecessary allocation. I'd probably be easier to pass in the parameters to be outputted:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef void f(double [:] x, double y, double [:] out_1, double *out_2):\r\n```\r\n(in this version I'm considering treating all parameters with a name starting with `out` as output parameters. Note that scalars outputs need to be pointers).\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef void g(double [:] x, double y, *, double[:] ret1, double *ret2):\r\n```\r\n(this version proposes using `*` to separate input and output parameters, which would require a parser change)\r\n\r\nI haven't got a good solution for this yet, and none of the solutions really handle scalar pyobjects.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
