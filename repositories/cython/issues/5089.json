Depending on how Cython is integrated into the Python package build system, there are different constraints that can apply.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which Cython can be integrated into the build system: the \"standard\" way via the extensions to setuptools which IIRC import Cython as a Python library, or via other build systems like meson-python (used for example by scipy) that invoke the cython compiler via the `cython` executable.\r\n\r\nFor setuptools integration, Cython needs to be available as an importable module in the build. Therefore it needs to be listed in the Python package build requirements. This means a Cython installation into the throw away build environment for each package build. For Cython compilation via the `cython` executable, the executable can come from the system (like the C compiler) or from a package installed in the throw away build environment.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I don't think that distributing pre-cythonized source files makes much sense and I don't do it for any of my projects.

This seems to have shifted. Over the years, I was advocating for generating the C code from Cython modules locally and shipping it as part of the source distribution. As long as the C-API (or the exposed internals) were stable enough, that was a good idea. If they no longer are, then it's less of a good idea. **The C code can get outdated and it's then really hard for users to regenerate it when all they want to do is pip-install a package into a new CPython version for which there's no wheel (and possibly never will be, for an unmaintained package).** This was a problem with the line_profiler package, for example, which, for a very long while, didn't receive an update with freshly generated C sources to support CPython 3.7, and the C sources failed to compile on that newly released CPython version at the time.",

Arguments:\r\n\r\n- Cython's code generation is deterministic (we consider exceptions to this a bug)\r\n- it's relatively easy and safe to install build time dependencies these days\r\n- \"always use Cython\" is often easier to set up than a conditional build that may use Cython or not\r\n- packagers can more easily update dependency versions than patch or partly rebuild a package\r\n- most build time these days is spent in source based CI builds rather than package based wheel builds (which would benefit from pre-built sources)\r\n\r\nAnother topic then is: pinning a specific Cython version or a .x release series in the dependencies. But that's the usual \"safe and known vs. unsafe and more future-proof\" debate that applies to all dependencies. I don't think there is a general path to recommend here, apart from stating a few pros and cons.\r\n\r\nPR(s) welcome.",

Is there an easy and generic way to *force* C-sources to be re-generated? In one package I noticed I could do `python setup.py clean` like `make clean`, but I was told this was a \"custom\" target.
