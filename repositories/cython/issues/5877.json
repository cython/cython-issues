They should either be `punycodify`ied (which also ends up with an `EncodedString` but one that consists just of ascii) or converted with `EncodedString.as_c_string_literal()` (which I think ends up with a regular Python string).\r\n\r\nFor the most part it's a mistake if `\"%s\" % some_arbitrary_encoded_string` gets into our code (or the modern formatted/fstring equivalent) but we get away most of the time because most of our tests use ASCII. It would be good if `EncodedString` was able to enforce that itself somehow to catch all the places we've missed.",
