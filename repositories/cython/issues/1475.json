    "body": "I was experimenting with writing a python wrapper for the C `libsox` library where the developers seem to use the convention of placing the `const` keyword _after_ the c type e.g.,\n\n```\nsox_bool\nLSX_API\nsox_is_playlist(\nLSX_PARAM_IN_Z char const * filename \n);\n```\n\nHowever, Cython raised a syntax error when trying to compile this. Switching the order of `char` and `const` in the above example lets Cython compile successfully.\n\nAs far as I know, the order of `char` and `const` is interchangeable in C. So is this a Cython bug? Or is this mentioned somewhere in the Cython documentation as known limitation? Because I couldn't find any mention of it.\n\nThis is verbatim the question I posted on stack overflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/39690481/position-of-const-in-declarations-matters?noredirect=1#comment66690601_39690481\n",
