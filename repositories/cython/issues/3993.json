Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```cython\r\ncimport cython\r\ncdef class Tuple0:\r\n    cdef readonly signed long v0\r\n    cdef readonly double v1\r\n    def __init__(self, signed long v0, double v1): self.v0 = v0; self.v1 = v1\r\ncpdef void main():\r\n    cdef Tuple0 [::1] v0\r\n    v0 = cython.view.array(shape=(10,), itemsize=sizeof(void *), format='O')\r\n    v0[0] = Tuple0(1, 2.000000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\Marko\\.pyxbld\\temp.win-amd64-3.8\\Release\\pyrex\\testm.c(2587): warning C4133: '=': incompatible types - from 'PyObject *' to '__pyx_obj_5testm_Tuple0 *'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt compiles fine, but a warning is emitted that the types are not compatible. Since the memoryview is correctly typed, I think this could be considered a minor error in the Cython compiler.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Win 10\r\n - Python version: 3.8.5\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.21",
