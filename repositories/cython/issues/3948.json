    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIn trying to create a Python class that subclasses an extension type and a pure Python class in pure Python, am running into issues with attributes missing from one of the base classes. Whichever base class is listed later in the subclass, appears to have its attributes missing. Not sure if I'm just missing something or if this is a bug.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython import cclass, double\r\n\r\n\r\n@cclass\r\nclass A:\r\n    _x: double\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, x: double = 0, **kwargs):\r\n        self._x = x\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def x(self):\r\n        return self._x\r\n\r\n\r\nclass B:\r\n    def __init__(self, y=2, **kwargs):\r\n        self.y = y\r\n\r\n\r\nclass C(A, B):  # swapping the order to `B, A` results in `x` being missing\r\n    def __init__(self, x=0, y=2):\r\n        super().__init__(x=x, y=y)\r\n        print((self.x, self.y))  # <--- AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'y'\r\n\r\n\r\nc = C(3, 4)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWould like both attributes to remain visible/usable in the subclass `C`.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS\r\n - Python version: 3.8.6\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.21\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNA",

The rules for inheriting extension types are somewhat fiddly, but generally`cdef` classes can only be the first class in the inheritance list (so `(B, A)` shouldn't work).\r\n2. `super` calls the _next_ constructor in the chain but nothing calls `B.__init__`. Generally you'd either call `super().__init__` in the base classes or call `B.__init__` directly from `C.__init__.`",
