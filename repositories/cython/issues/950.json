At least in current versions of Cython, unless compiling with docstrings stripped out, for functions accessible from Python this isn't entirely needed because their doctests can still be introspected from the Python level.\r\n\r\nTo me, this seems most useful for docstrings that would not otherwise be accessible from Python, such as for `cdef` functions.  This can be enabled by setting `autotestdict.cdef = True`, but this is *not* even the default.  It also explicitly excludes special methods like `__cinit__` and `__dealloc__` on the basis that they are \"not accessible from Python\", but this is also true for any `cdef` functions, and it still seems like a case could be made for wanting to introspect the docstrings/doctests for these methods as well.\r\n\r\n@dagss Do you have any idea?",

            "body": "One reason I was looking into this is thinking about the possibility of switching SageMath to using pytest as its test runner.  For that, being able to document cdef functions would be useful (I agree that in most cases cdef functions are still tested implicitly by tests for wrapper code, but Sage still has tons of doctests in cdef functions for historic reasons).\r\n\r\nHowever, I found that there is no combination of settings that allow creating a `__test__` dict *just* for cdef functions.  So maybe I would propose disabling this by default, but making it possible to test cdef functions if, e.g. `autotestdict.all == False` and `autotestdict.cdef == True`.",
