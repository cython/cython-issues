Among these are [aliases for const types](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/18e0961d0813120e6e31b812f9bc9d23554db7bf/Cython/Shadow.py#L546), which are also [declared for typing purposes in Shadow.pyi](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/18e0961d0813120e6e31b812f9bc9d23554db7bf/Cython/Shadow.pyi#L270) so that we can see exactly what types are being added. I'm focusing on const types because that is the case that I hit, but in principle any of the other aliases could run into the same problem. The issue is that if a user's Cython code already contains these aliases, the new aliases will silently shadow the existing ones and could break in surprising ways. As a result of https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4180, these aliases are currently the only way to declare template types with qualifiers for these purposes, so it is likely that such aliases have proliferated through at least a few code bases.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\n# test.pxd\n# distutils: language = c++\n# cython: language_level = 3\n\nfrom libc.stdint cimport int64_t\n\n# Cython doesn't like `const float` inside template parameters\n# hack around this with using typedefs\nctypedef const float const_float\n\n\ncdef extern from \"*\":\n    # Note that I am not including true definitions of these types in C++, so this\n    # code would fail to compile if the Cython->C++ transpilation succeeded. I\n    # have real headers that define these types but am omitting them here for brevity.\n    cdef cppclass row_major:\n        pass\n\n    cdef cppclass device_matrix_view[ElementType, IndexType, LayoutType]:\n        pass\n\n    cdef device_matrix_view[ElementType, IndexType, LayoutPolicy] \\\n        make_device_matrix_view[ElementType, IndexType, LayoutPolicy]()\n\ncdef device_matrix_view[const_float, int64_t, row_major] get_const_dmv_float()\n\n\n# test.pyx\n# distutils: language = c++\n# cython: language_level = 3\n\nfrom libc.stdint cimport int64_t, uintptr_t\n\ncdef device_matrix_view[const_float, int64_t, row_major] get_const_dmv_float():\n    return make_device_matrix_view[const_float, int64_t, row_major]()\n```\n\nThe error that I see is\n```bash\nError compiling Cython file:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n...\n# distutils: language = c++\n# cython: language_level = 3\n\nfrom libc.stdint cimport int64_t, uintptr_t\n\ncdef device_matrix_view[const_float, int64_t, row_major] get_const_dmv_float():\n^\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\ntest.pyx:6:0: Function signature does not match previous declaration\n```\nI assume that this is failing because the definition of `const_float` in test.pyx and test.pxd are disagreeing because in test.pyx Cython is preferring its internally defined `const_float` alias to the one defined in test.pxd.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nIdeally the compiler would detect that a ctypedef declaration of this type was shadowing an existing Cython definition and avoid shadowing it. It might also make sense to warn the user if such shadowing of types was occurring and ask them to change their code to avoid those types, but that would require restricting the set of acceptable aliases in a somewhat artificial way and I don't know if the project wants to do that.\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13.3\n\n### Cython version\n\nCommit c77ba9c7119d3527cf51e579b6d03746f1902cf4\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
