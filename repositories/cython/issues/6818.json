This only happens if `cdef extern void* c_function()` is inside of a function, if it is outside everything is gucci.\nSame result with a `cdef extern from *` block.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\ncdef void example():\n    cdef extern void* c_function()\n    cdef void* result = c_function()\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nCython should generate a forward declaration for `c_function`\n\n### OS\n\nWindows\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13.0\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.12, master\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

It makes no sense at all to allow C includes, verbatim C code, or extern declarations inside of a function context. Cython cannot control code injected into a function this way, potentially leading to arbitrary conflicts with exception handling or type inference assumptions. So the effect would always have to be global, which means that a global declaration is the right place.\n",
