I can identify the code where the `__pyx_t_npy_float64_complex`type is used, but if I isolate it, I do not observe this problem.\r\nThe classes, which use this type, are rather complex. They glue together PETSc, FFTW and LAPACK, which all use different representations for complex numbers. The lines where the problem appears, however, just computes entries of a complex array, which are products and sums of real and complex numbers. This looks, for example like this\r\n```\r\nfor j in range(self.grid.nv):\r\n    diag[j] = eigen * 0.5 * ( 2. * self.grid.hv * v[j] ) * fac\r\n```\r\nHere, diag and eigen are dcomplex, everything else is double.\r\n\r\nI just observed a very interesting effect. The array `v` is defined by\r\n```\r\ncdef double[:] v = self.grid.v\r\n```\r\nIf I disable this line and replace `v`in the above code by `self.grid.v`, i.e., \r\n```\r\nfor j in range(self.grid.nv):\r\n    diag[j] = eigen * 0.5 * ( 2. * self.grid.hv * self.grid.v[j] ) * fac\r\n```\r\nthe problem magically disappears. In the `grid` class, `v` is defined by\r\n```\r\ncdef readonly np.ndarray v\r\n```\r\nObviously, this is some old code where the `np.ndarray` should be replace with `double[:]`. But again, isolating this does not show the problem. Also, changing the definition of `grid.v` to `double[:]` does not solve the problem.",
