    "body": "Recently reached for [`PyArray_GetPtr`]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/c-api.array.html#c.PyArray_GetPtr ), to get quick C level access into a location in a NumPy array. Went to release the GIL as this function does not create any Python objects, but was surprised to find that [Cython requires the GIL for it]( https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/5dfefdadf6c20bf631ea3b6e567eede2f1ddd3d0/Cython/Includes/numpy/__init__.pxd#L718 ). Started to make a PR, but quickly discovered there are many such functions like [`PyArray_NDIM`]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/c-api.array.html#c.PyArray_NDIM ), [`PyArray_STRIDES`]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/c-api.array.html#c.PyArray_STRIDES ), [`PyArray_DATA`]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/c-api.array.html#c.PyArray_DATA ), etc. that are also marked as requiring the GIL even though they are providing convenient access to `struct` members. Given the scope and the discussion in issue ( https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11803 ), figured we should discuss the right way forward.",

If the NumPy devs agree that they want to support GIL-free access to them in the future, then we can adapt to that in Cython. One more reason to let NumPy ship its own declarations for Cython code.",
