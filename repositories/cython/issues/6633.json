If I remember correctly that was deferred because it wasn't possible to support all features all versions of Python that we support (I think the buffer protocol might have been an issue?).\n\nHowever - the types in the Shared ABI (cyfunction, fused_function, generator, coroutine, etc.) use a narrower set of features and I think (but haven't tested) that they could work all heap types (`CYTHON_USE_TYPE_SPECS`) on all versions that we support now. Doing that would cut out a large chunk of code, and remove a one of the points of divergence where we have to create multiple shared ABI modules.\n\nSo the question is: is there any good reason not to do this, and to keep these in sync with `cdef class` types.",
