However some other objects like typed-memoryviews (`const char[:]`) can't be compiled. Even though both `bytes` and `bytearray` can be passed into functions that have an appropriate typed-memoryview argument. To make it easier to work with other `bytes`-like objects that have a byte-based type (`char`, `unsigned char`, etc.), it would be desirable to also add conversions for these types to `std::string`. IOW allowing the second case below to work as well\n\n```cython\n# distutils: language = c++\n# cython: language_level=3\n\n\nfrom libcpp.string cimport string as std_string\n\n\ncpdef bytes_to_std_string(bytes b):\n    cdef std_string s = b  # works\n\n\ncpdef chars_to_std_string(const char[:] b):\n    cdef std_string s = b  # cython error\n```\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
