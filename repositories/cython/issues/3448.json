    "body": "This is a sister post to this entry on the pypy side:\r\n\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/3039/cython-arrayarray-bindings-generate-errors\r\n\r\nThat was posted by someone else, but I believe I'm getting the same issue.  Here's my issue:\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use keras in pypy3.  Keras depends on h5py.  h5py depends on Cython.  Cython does not seem to be working in pypy3.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[user@lob cli]$ pypy3\r\nPython 3.6.9 (1608da62bfc7, Dec 23 2019, 10:50:04)\r\n[PyPy 7.3.0 with GCC 7.3.1 20180303 (Red Hat 7.3.1-5)] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>>> import h5py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/root/.local/lib/pypy3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py\", line 55, in <module>\r\n    from . import h5a, h5d, h5ds, h5f, h5fd, h5g, h5r, h5s, h5t, h5p, h5z, h5pl\r\n  File \".eggs/Cython-0.29.15-py3.6.egg/Cython/Includes/cpython/array.pxd\", line 58, in init h5py.h5d\r\nValueError: array.array size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility.

The cache has been disabled. Check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.\r\nPackage    Version\r\n---------- -------\r\ncffi       1.13.2 \r\ngreenlet   0.4.13 \r\nh5py       2.10.0 \r\nnumpy      1.18.1 \r\npip        20.0.2 \r\nreadline   6.2.4.1\r\nsetuptools 45.1.0 \r\nsix        1.14.0 \r\nwheel      0.34.2 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe conclusion in the first thread was:\r\n\r\n> It seems cython assumes an arrayobject [cython/Include/array.pxd](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Includes/cpython/array.pxd#L88) will have known ob_size, ob_descr and data, where all we give cython is the PyObject* HEAD (24 bytes). So cython cannnot be sure the other fields exist. It seems cython is willing to “cheat” and assume it knows the inner structure here, which will not work on PyPy.\r\n\r\nI'd really like someone's help getting a cython version that will work in pypy.  I can probably work with h5py to get it integrated into their package so that keras can run.  A lot of data scientist doing machine learning depend on keras, and being able to write fast looped code is a huge benefit that pypy offers.  It would be great to have things working in harmony.  \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your consideration. :)\r\n\r\n",
