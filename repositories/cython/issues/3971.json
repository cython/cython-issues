Please describe.**\r\nFeature Request\r\n\r\nWith the ever growing world of IOT it would be nice to see Cython get used on the devices that run MicroPython.\r\nMicroPython is a CPython port that runs on micro controllers/soc devices. It interfaces with the hardware available on these devices and has close to the full std libraries available as well as libraries that have been made for sensors that are able to be attached to the devices that MicroPython runs on. \r\n\r\nI don't see an immediate need to be able to bind to a C library, but what would be extremely useful is Cythons ability to convert Python code into C code and compile it as a C extension module. This would be really useful because of the hardware limitations of the devices. Python does carry with it a decent amount of overhead, this overhead is really seen when running Python on a resource handicapped device such as those used in IOT devices. Compiling python code into C extensions would give a pretty significant boost in performance to code running on one of these devices.\r\n\r\nI believe that coupling MicroPython and Cython would really show the power of both applications. It would give the IOT world something really awesome by unlocking the potential of these devices in a way that even a \"newbie\" developer would be able to do.\r\n",

It's genuinely a fork from CPython and so the C API compatibility is fairly close. In contrast MicroPython looks to be a from-scratch implementation of Python with a completely different C API. Pretty much every single line of utility code that we generate would need to be different.\r\n\r\n> I do not see a need to attach Python code to an existing C library, this is something that gets done on a full blown PC. There aren't any C libraries written so they would run on a micro controller in a manner that would be able to be used. I am looking at it from compiling python code into a C extension only for the performance gains, which are going to be really substantial.\r\n\r\nI think that wrapping C libraries would actually be the easy bit - it probably wouldn't need any changes at all. Compiling Python code to a completely new C API would be where all the work is.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf someone was to do this I suspect the way forward would be:\r\n1. Write a wrapper for the MicroPython C API that maps to the CPython limited API (since the limited API is designed to hide the implementation details of CPython, this would probably be easier than mapping to the regular CPython API). This wrapper would probably go into MicroPython rather than Cython.\r\n2. Improve Cython's support for the limited API (which will probably happen anyway over time, but very basic code might work right now).\r\n\r\nI'll stop commenting here, because I don't think I have much more to add.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nQuick edit: I definitely agree that it'd be nice. But I think it needs someone with a real interest it MicroPython to make a significant start on it.",
