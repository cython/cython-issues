If all `__del__` is doing is deleting a C object, perhaps it would be reasonable to raise a hard error and require using `__dealloc__`, but that still leaves the possibility of other meaningful behaviors of `__del__`. At minimum it seems like if `__del__` becomes a no-op then we can't have that be silent and Cython should raise a hard error somewhere, right?\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12.6\n\n### Cython version\n\nlimited-api-preview branch as of https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/984b763b7ae3e35640b8ee3dea74de51cb450f92\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

We're missing `PyObject_CallFinalizerFromDealloc`, which isn't in the Limited API or even the doucmentation. That takes care of a lot of the \"see if the object gets resurrected\" which just isn't possible in the limited API.\r\n\r\n> If all `__del__` is doing is deleting a C object\r\n\r\nIn this case the right thing to do is using `__dealloc__`. `__dealloc__` is absolutely guaranteed to be called exactly once. `__del__` may be called 0, 1 or many times (largely because it relies on inheriting classes to call it via `super()`). So `__dealloc__` is the right place for C cleanup that _must_ happen, in the same way as `__cinit__` is the place for C initialization that _must_ happen.\r\n\r\n> At minimum it seems like if `__del__` becomes a no-op then we can't have that be silent and Cython should raise a hard error somewhere, right?\r\n\r\nI don't think it can be a hard compile-time error because `__del__` might be defined in a derived type that we can't see. (I could be misremembering this though).  Possibly a runtime warning might be worthwhile though.  The limited API isn't the only build that skips finalize.",
