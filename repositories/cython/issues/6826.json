    "body": "I'd like for there to be some API or wrapper around e.g. `std::call_once` or `std::once_flag` in the C++ standard library or equivalent functionality in C23 `threads.h`. You could backfill with default implementations that use e.g. a mutex and an atomic flag for code that doesn't use sufficiently new C or C++ standards.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI'd like to be able to do something like this:\n\n```cython\n\n@cython.call_once\ndef initialize_global():\n    global cache\n    cache = {\"hello\": \"world\"}\n```\n\nTotally spitballing the API and interface here. In this example the decorator ensures that if multiple threads try to call `initialize_global` simultaneously, only one thread calls the function and all others block.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nYou can do this right now by using e.g. C++ standard library APIs but it would be nice if Cython provided first-class support for this. Also there are deadlock risks that Cython can mitigate somewhat in the general case.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe need for this is more acute on the free-threaded build. AFAICS there isn't any discussion in the free-threading docs about initializing global state in a thread-safe manner. Let me know if I missed something that already exists.",

Both C and C++ `call_once` are now available in the main branch.\n\nI've generally been reluctant to start implementing our own versions of this kind of thing. `pymutex` and `critical_section` are exceptions to that because they're really just exposing Python API.\n\nWith that said... I wouldn't be opposed to making it easier to use `std::call_once` with a Python object and hopefully handling some of the deadlock stuff there. I've tried to do something like that with `std::stop_callback` in https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6820/files and I was considering doing something similar with `std::condition_variable(_any)` in the near future.
