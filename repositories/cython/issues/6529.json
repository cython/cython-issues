Please describe.\n\nI'm writing a library in Cython and my code currently defines a lot of various extension classes and each has a lot of properties ([Here](https://github.com/axeldavy/DearCyGui)) .\r\n\r\nI'd like to enable users to call the Cython code directly without Python overhead when they need extra performance.\r\nThe issue I face is that while the Python interface should be rather stable, internals can change. I don't think users should access the extension class private fields directly. In other words, I'd like that these users would be able to use the \"public\" attributes, i.e. the properties, rather than the private ones.\r\n\r\nI'd like to reuse the setters and getters defined in properties for this Cython interfacing, but currently it is not possible to use cpdef functions in properties. Writing setters and getters specific for Cython users would be a huge task and code duplication. Thus this current enhancement request.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
