This would also give us a suitable vehicle for shipping the PEP-484 typing stub for Cython's type system, by including it in that package.\r\n\r\nAlso see #2531 for an extension to that package that would include parts of the build system.",

The idea being that could could say\r\n\r\n```\r\nOption.cython_cimport_module_name = \"mypackage.cython\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then `cimport mypackage.cython` would work exactly like `cimport cython`. With that done it'd be possible for users to distribute a copy of `Shadow.py` with their own package and have it be both imported correctly and used by the Cython compiler",
