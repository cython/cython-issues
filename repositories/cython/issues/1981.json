So it needs to be kept fairly strictly backwards compatible.

Cython_Shadow should follow common compatibility as any other library so I think is nothing unusual. We can still deprecate API etc. and users should be able to pin the version anyway\r\n2. In Cython we must already keep strict backward compatibility.
