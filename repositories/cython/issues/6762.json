Please describe.\n\nSometimes, a `pxd` file contains a `inline` function declaration, for example SageMath:\n\nhttps://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/1ca4a47dbd7c59f09b4840d66f6ced9edde9686a/src/sage/cpython/string.pxd#L18-L51\n\nSometimes a `pyx` file wants to use only one of these inline functions, so it includes the header, but then the C compiler complains about unused function.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI think it would be good to either automatically mark all `inline` function as `maybe_unused`, or otherwise have some way to allow the user to type `__attribute__((maybe_unused))` in `pxd` file.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

We keep track of whether an inline function is actually used and discard it otherwise, but it's used here, just not from actual user code. It might be difficult to keep track of that transitively and still making sure that all dependencies also end up in the C code.",
