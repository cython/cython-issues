Using `nox` I made a virtualenv with only `Cython==3.0.10` as the dependency.\r\n\r\nAdding `numpy==2.0.0` to that virtualenv fixed the issue, thanks!\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHopefully this issue will serve as documentation / something people can search for on this issue.\r\n\r\nI have been updating my `_speedup.c` with this virtual environment since August 2017 or so and have never installed `numpy` into it. I wonder how many others are in this same situation (seems like not too many given the Google search results / GitHub issue search results on this topic).",
