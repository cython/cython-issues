The compiler will tell you about this.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, if there was a tool which grabs `cdef` or `cpdef` function or class API from `.pyx` files and puts them in a `.pxd`, the `cdef` attributes would have to be removed from the `.pyx` `cdef` classes (otherwise compilation will fail), and the next attempt to automatically generate the `.pxd` would then be missing the `cdef` attributes.\r\n\r\nIf we were to remove the restriction above, instead introducing the compilation check that `cdef` attributes in classes are consistent between `.pyx` and `.pxd` files (like how `cdef/cpdef` methods are checked for signature consistency between `.pyx` and `.pxd` files), would there be any issues? See expected mockup below:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# shruberry.pxd\r\ncdef class Shrubbery:\r\n    cdef int width  # OK\r\n    cdef double height  # Desired error message: \"Attribute not compatible with previous declaration\"\r\n    cdef void describe(self)\r\n\r\n# shruberry.pyx\r\ncdef class Shrubbery:\r\n    cdef int width  # OK\r\n    cdef int height  # Desired error message: \"Previous declaration is here\"\r\n    def __init__(self, w, h):\r\n        self.width = w\r\n        self.height = h\r\n\r\n    cdef void describe(self):\r\n        print(\"This shrubbery is\", self.width,\r\n              \"by\", self.height, \"cubits.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, this fails with `C attributes cannot be added in implementation part of extension type defined in a pxd`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo be clear - I'm not suggesting that attributes *must* exist in the `cdef` classes in `.pyx` files, as that would break a lot of existing code. Just that, if they exist both in the `.pyx` and `.pxd`, they must be consistent.",
