A memoryview itself doesn't have an ID.\r\n\r\nWhat you see is a fairly reasonable outcome (although not the only outcome). In CPython an ID is just a pointer converted to an `int`. So if you create a temporary Python object `id(W)`, destroy it, then create a second temporary Python object (`id(W1)`) it's pretty reasonable they'd appear to be the same since it reuses the same memory location.\r\n\r\n`id(W) != id(W1)` ends up different because both temporary objects have to exist for the duration of the line.\r\n\r\nSo, not a bug. `id` of a memoryview simply isn't meaningful.",
