Please describe.\n\nIn my code, I would like to do nothing different.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nRight now `__getstate__` returns nothing, while `__setstate__` correctly sets values. I think it'd be nice for `__getstate__` to return what can be passed to `__setstate__`. This information is already provided by `__reduce__()[1][2]`, but I'd like to be able to simply do:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nobj = MyCythonObj(...)\r\nobj_state = obj.__getstate__()\r\nnew_obj = type(obj).__new__(type(obj))\r\nnew_obj.__setstate__(obj_state)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is going to help us easily support cython objects in https://github.com/skops-dev/skops, which persists / loads objects w/o using pickle.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

If you target `__reduce__`, then it should work with all objects that support the pickle protocol, whereas if you require `__getstate__`, then that's not necessarily the case, AFAIU.\r\n\r\nYes it is, but it also opens the door to easily creating malicious pickle objects. The point in `skops` is that we don't rely on objects' `__reduce__`. It means we can't pickle everything, but we already support pretty much the whole sklearn objects. For instance, for numpy, we rely on `numpy.save/load` instead of pickling them.",
