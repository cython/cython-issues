    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nCython compiler is crashing in the Cythonize phase with a \"please report a bug\" message.\n\nWhen using the type of a fused type argument in a class method Cython crashes without reporting a useful message. Cython does not crash when a very similar function is not part of a class, or when the `cython.typeof` function is used.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\n# fused_type_crash.pyx\ncimport cython\n\ncdef extern from * nogil:\n    void bar[T]()\n\ncdef class Foo:\n\n    cdef void foo(Foo self, cython.floating x):\n        bar[cython.floating]()\n\n    # cdef void foo(Foo self, cython.floating x):\n    #     bar[cython.typeof(x)]()\n\n# cdef void foo2(cython.floating x):\n#     bar[cython.floating]()\n\n```\n\n```bash\n$ cythonize --cplus fused_type_crash.pyx\n```\n\nThe commented out version of `foo`  does not crash Cython, nor does `foo2` even without the use of `cython.typeof`.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nA more helpful error message would be greatly appreciated. Additionally the difference between the function being part of a class or not is confusing, as I understand it, `foo2` should raise a compiler error noting the the type cannot be specialised.\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12.7\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.11\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt also seems this behaviour (using fused types types in C++ templates) is undocumented. I'm finding this feature quite useful for wrapping a custom C++ class with some templated methods. Is this documented somewhere else?\nSpecifically I'm using the runtime dispatch of a fused type method to selected a function that uses a templated C++ method based on the type of the fused type argument (often optional and unused).",
