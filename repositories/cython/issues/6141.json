See [this section of the docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/special_methods.html#initialisation-methods-cinit-and-init):\r\n> Alternatively, as a convenience, if you declare your __cinit__() method to take no arguments (other than self) it will simply ignore any extra arguments passed to the constructor without complaining about the signature mismatch.\r\n\r\nThe issue is moreso that not defining `__init__` means there’s no code at all doing the argument checking, I think?",

Allowing the same in `__cinit__()` would add complexity without benefit.\r\n\r\nIf you use `__cinit__()` in the intended way, then it's actually quite helpful that you can let it ignore its arguments without requiring args tuple+dict, and without taking care of subclasses and their call signature.",
