            "body": "* `g` is a `def` function. The function is a regular Python call - i.e. a `getattr` type lookup on the instance, a Python object is passed, and then it calls a specific implementation of `g` based on the fused type that best matches the Python object. It resolves this at runtime. Because the whole thing goes through `getattr` it works as expected.\r\n\r\n* `f` is a `cdef` function. It is not callable from Python.\r\n  * Without fused types the mechanism for calling `cdef` functions is a lot like a C++ virtual function (i.e. the class stores a pointer to a table of function pointers and those are called). This works for inherited classes.\r\n  * With fused types - the fused type is picked at compile time (which is nice because it's faster). Somehow it looks like the table of function pointers mechanism isn't being generated correctly, or isn't being used. Because it's a different mechanism it's expected that it behaves differently.\r\n\r\n* There's a third case with `cpdef` functions. I don't actually know how that behaves. It probably depends whether you call it from Python or Cython.\r\n\r\nWhat `g` is contributing to this test is that `self` is implicitly typed as `A` or a derived class (but the \"or a derived class\" is being ignored), and that each implementation of `g` attempts to call a single, known-at-compile-time, matching implementation of `f`.\r\n\r\nSo essentially the summary is calling `cdef` (and maybe `cpdef`?) functions that have fused type arguments doesn't work with derived classes.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIt's definitely a bug that it does doesn't work for `f`. Exactly how these function pointer tables are generated is a bit of a mystery to me unfortunately. But hopefully that gives some idea of where it works and doesn't work.",
