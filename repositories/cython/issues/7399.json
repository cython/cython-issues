    "body": "It is anticipated that Python 3.15 will support a version of the Limited API that means the same extension will be importable in both regular and free-threading Python. Some of the details are still to be decided but Cython aims to support this.\n\nTo let you start testing this early I've pushed a [`freethreading-limited-api-preview`](https://github.com/cython/cython/tree/freethreading-limited-api-preview) branch to this repo. This branch is intended to be fairly short-lived and will be deleted once it's all merge into the repo.  The branch will probably not be kept rigorously up-to-date with other Cython bug fixes\n\nIt's a merge of the following PRs and branches:\n\n- [ ] https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/7382\n- [ ] https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/7190\n- [ ] https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/7333\n- [ ] https://github.com/da-woods/cython/tree/cdef-class-opaque-pyobject\n- [ ] https://github.com/da-woods/cython/tree/async-opaque-object\n\nBe aware that it is missing some some bits of internal thread safety which would be provided by critical sections and PyMutexes since these have not yet been added to the Limited API.\n\n# To use\n\nDefine the following `CFLAGS` when you build:\n\n```\n-DPy_LIMITED_API=0x030F0000 -DCYTHON_OPAQUE_OBJECTS=1 -D_Py_OPAQUE_PYOBJECT\n```\n\nBuild with as recent alpha of Python 3.15 as you can.\n\nSet up your build system normally so that the modules are named `abi3.so` (see https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/limited_api.html#building-with-the-limited-api for some hints)\n\n# Known Limitations\n\nAnything involving an extern type (`cdef extern class` or similar) is unlikely to work.\n\nPerformance is about 13% slower compare with the `Py_LIMITED_API=0x030E0000` - essentially every access to an attribute of a cdef class goes through a painful indirect lookup.\n\nSome thread-safety guards missing right now.",
