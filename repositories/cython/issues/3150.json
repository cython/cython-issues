Let's continue the discussion in this issue since it leaves the scope of a PR.\r\n\r\nAn example is:\r\n```cython\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def c03(type cls: type[Foo], unsigned int a: int) -> float: return a\r\n```\r\nwhere the Cython type declarations (and note that this only works in Cython `.pyx` syntax) are more specific and concrete than the Python type annotations, but the latter can be used to generate user defined text signatures and `.pyi` stub files. The main issue here are the two audiences of the declarations. Python type annotations are geared towards humans, whereas the Cython C type declaration is meant for the compiler.\r\n\r\n@dalcinl wrote:\r\n> Remember that \"Python type declarations\" are actually just annotations.\r\n\r\n… unless you use them as the way you declare types for Cython. In that case, they are type declarations, not just annotations. The fact that you can mix both in `.pyx` files is, well, limited to `.pyx` files. It doesn't help users who write their Cython code in `.py` modules to tell them that their life could be so much easier and cooler if they switched to non-Python syntax extensions and renamed their files. We are currently trying to discourage writing new code in Cython syntax and use Python syntax instead, simply because there is much more tooling available for writing Python code than for Cython code.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should reject the mix of both as invalid syntax, but I also wouldn't want to present mixing both forms of type declarations as the best of both worlds. I don't want Python type annotations to be considered a second class citizen that is only looked at if there is nothing more convincing and can otherwise be happily ignored by the compiler. Any redundancy in code bares a potential risk of getting outdated, out of sync, and generally confusing. I consider duplicate type declarations something that Cython might warn about, not something to encourage.\r\n\r\n@dalcinl suggested:\r\n> ```python\r\n> def foo(int arg: Annotated[int, MaxValueAllowed(42)]) -> Any:\r\n>     ...\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIn Python syntax, you would spell it as follows:\r\n```python\r\ndef foo(arg: Annotated[cython.int, MaxValueAllowed(42)]) -> Any:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nI don't see why the two type declarations should be preferred over a single one here.",
