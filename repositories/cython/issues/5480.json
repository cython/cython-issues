Since .pyi files are very similar to .pxd files, I would like to only have to maintain .pyi files and let Cython get function signatures or variable types from my .pyi files. I have seen some issues regarding converting `.pxd` files into `.pyi` files, but I feel that Python typehints can be more descriptive and are used more widely.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```py\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    def __init__(self, a: int) -> None: ...\r\n```\r\nwould generate:\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class Foo:\r\n    cpdef void __init__(self, int a)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `cythonize` could be provided with a path to a stub folder where the stubs would be read from. This would eliminate the need for intermediary `.pxd` files.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Python methods are not `cpdef` methods, Python classes are not extension types, and Python `int` is not a C `int`. The mere fact that a `.pyi` file exists that contains Python declarations does not allow Cython to generate efficient C code.\r\n\r\nYou could probably [use Cython types](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html#pep-484-type-annotations) in your `.pyi` files, in which case it would be nice if Cython was able to pick them up. However, I'm not sure right now if decorators like `@cython.cclass` and `@cython.ccall` can be supported in `.pyi` files.\r\n\r\nThus, I'm not really convinced that this feature would be as helpful as you seem to think.",
