Since .pyi files are very similar to .pxd files, I would like to only have to maintain .pyi files and let Cython get function signatures or variable types from my .pyi files. I have seen some issues regarding converting `.pxd` files into `.pyi` files, but I feel that Python typehints can be more descriptive and are used more widely.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```py\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    def __init__(self, a: int) -> None: ...\r\n```\r\nwould generate:\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class Foo:\r\n    cpdef void __init__(self, int a)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `cythonize` could be provided with a path to a stub folder where the stubs would be read from. This would eliminate the need for intermediary `.pxd` files.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
