It's not 100% consistent but i consider it still more straightforward than having special logic for `.pxd` files or having two values for propagation (`0` and `-1`)?\r\n\r\nNo big complication - the options that I'm considering are:\r\n\r\n* Use `0` as the error value for fused functions (as you suggest). The disadvantages are\r\n\r\n  * it's inconsistent (so it'll catch a few people out making function pointers etc)\r\n  * `0` is probably a more common return value than `-1` so it'll probably perform work (but still better than `except *`).\r\n    \r\n  The advantages are that it works now.\r\n\r\n* Use `0` as the value for fused functions defined in pxd files and `-1` elsewhere. The disadvantages are\r\n\r\n  * it's *very* inconsistent\r\n  * Probably quite complicated to implement\r\n\r\n* Return `-1` from all fused functions. Assume `except *` when calling the function if there isn't a local definition. At some point in the future when nobody's using Cython 3.0.0 we can switch the check everywhere.\r\n\r\n  * The advantage is that it ends up consistent eventually.\r\n  * The disadvantage is that it doesn't perform well now.\r\n\r\n* Return `-1` from all fused functions. Check for `-1` *and* `0` for fused functions where there isn't a local definition. Switch at some point in the future.\r\n  * Advantage: ends up consistent, performs OK now\r\n  * Disadvantage: hard to implement.\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure what the best option is (except I really don't like the second one). Still thinking. I have about 50% of an implementation, but haven't had time to finish it yet",
