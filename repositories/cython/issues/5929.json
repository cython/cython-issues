In my specific use case, I have defined custom typings for the `builtins` module, so that the Intellisense of my IDE (VC Code) does not get polluted with unnecessary identifiers.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n# This code was run in a Jupyter environment with the following magics (although the bug can be reproduced outside Jupyter):\r\n# %load_ext cython\r\n# %%cython\r\n\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\nimport builtins\r\nfrom builtins import * # The code works if this line is commented out.\r\n\r\n@cython.cfunc\r\ndef calc_sum(data: cython.double[:]):\r\n    return 0.0\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe code should work without removing the line `from builtins import *`.\n\n### OS\n\nWindows\n\n### Python version\n\nPython 3.11.4\n\n### Cython version\n\nCython version 3.0.7\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
