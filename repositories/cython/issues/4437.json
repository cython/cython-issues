Please describe.**\r\nI have a problem that I have outlined in the mailing list (linked below) that would be greatly simplified if I could use the include statement within the body of a class.\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/g/cython-users/c/FJzP0x9DTPM\r\nThe docs say that the include statement \"cannot ... be used outside of the module scope, such as inside ... class bodies.\"\r\nhttps://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#the-include-statement-and-include-files\r\nThe compiler throws an error as is expected.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reasoning behind this?\r\n\r\nI have tried modifying the code to allow it to work within class bodies and in the cases I have tested it it seems to work just fine.\r\nThe modification is to add \"c_class\" to the tuple on this line\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/719553db360261c082386cc2a81d5937861a6990/Cython/Compiler/Parsing.py#L2340\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to know the reasoning why the include statement is not allowed in a class. The docs say it isn't but don't explain why it isn't.\r\nIf there is a reason why it isn't it would be great if there was a way to monkey patch just that tuple rather than the whole function since it works in the case I need it in.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe only alternative to the problem outlined above is to manually copy the code (50-100 lines) about 12 times which will become problematic to maintain.\r\n",

For example, it isn't obvious to me what level of indentation included class-scope code should be at, or if it matters.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure we're keen to expand the \"include\" mechanism - it was largely replaced by using .pxd files in most causes so is mainly a legacy feature.\r\n\r\nIn terms of alternatives - I suspect you're better using a string substitution preprocessing step instead. Scipy uses Cython's \"tempita\" language for this in a few places (e.g. https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/701ffcc8a6f04509d115aac5e5681c538b5265a2/scipy/sparse/_csparsetools.pyx.in).",

There were probably also a couple of semantic uncertainties that we didn't want to dive into.\r\n\r\nI don't feel like that situation has fundamentally changed.\r\n\r\nAs @da-woods suggests, it seems that code generation is a better way to get what you want (it usually is).

You can also Cython-compile it to make it faster. :) (And it looks like we already do that. :)) )\r\n\r\nIt's pretty much in the state it was back in 2008(?), with only minor Py3 related adaptations.\r\n\r\nRegarding the usage, we [really just do](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/fa8db66368a9527c8df441a0bbfee714eb795930/Cython/Compiler/Code.py#L627-L638) `_tempita.sub(code, **vars)`.
