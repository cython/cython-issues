    "body": "This is an issue to summarize the current status of NumPy C API support and what can/should be done to update Cython. (cc @mattip, this is what I was talking about yesterday - could be a useful thing to work on).\r\n\r\nCurrently Cython uses a NumPy API that has been deprecated since NumPy 1.6.0 in 2013. \r\n- Example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25789055/cython-numpy-warning-about-npy-no-deprecated-api-when-using-memoryview\r\n\r\nThe Cython docs say [here](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html): \"For the time being, it is just a warning that you can ignore.\".\r\n\r\nIt is about time to update this, it will save users a lot of confusion and shorten the build logs of many projects by hundreds of lines.\r\n\r\n@nouiz wrote a summary of how to support both old (<1.6.0) and new API: \r\n- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/2573 (meant as a Cython issue, but never reopened here as far as I can tell)\r\n- https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2013-November/068172.html\r\n\r\nI would suggest that it's either no longer needed to support the old <1.6 API, or make that opt-in rather than the default (to avoid all the build warnings while remaining compatible with very old NumPy versions). Would be good to get the opinion of the Cython team on this before starting work on this.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of changing to the new API and avoiding the build warnings for `scipy.optimize`: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/4351/files. Linking because the use of  ``numpy_nodepr_api`` there (the defines and passing them to `distutils`) may be useful to other projects; it's a bit nontrivial to get right.",

            "body": "I put some work into this. I did not make it into a PR yet, the work is on a [branch in my fork](https://github.com/mattip/cython/tree/class-setter) because I am really unsure about this. I made both [pandas](https://github.com/mattip/pandas/commit/9113bf7e55e1eddece3544c1ad3ef2a761b5210a) and [scipy](https://github.com/mattip/scipy/tree/update-numpy-api) work with this branch of cython. Here are way too many of my random thoughts about the process, with some questions at the end.\r\n### Cython\r\n\r\n#### `getter` ctypedef class attribute functions (probably a bad idea)\r\n\r\nWhat to do with python-syntax (or cython-syntax) code like `a.ndims`? Currently it is compiled to `a.nd` in C, but now needs to become `PyArray_NDIMS(__pyx_v_a)`. I hacked the syntax feature that turns `ndims` into `\"nd\"` and make it into a getter function. So the `\"nd\"` c-level attribute access\r\n```\r\nctypedef class numpy.ndarray [object PyArrayObject]:\r\n        cdef __cythonbufferdefaults__ = {\"mode\": \"strided\"}\r\n        cdef:\r\n            # Convert python __getattr__ access to c -> access.\r\n            int ndims \"nd\"\r\n```\r\nnow becomes this `PyArray_NDIMS(self)` getter function\r\n```\r\nctypedef class numpy.ndarray [object PyArrayObject]:\r\n        cdef __cythonbufferdefaults__ = {\"mode\": \"strided\"}\r\n        cdef:\r\n            # Convert python __getattr__ access to c functions.\r\n            int ndims PyArray_NDIMS\r\n```\r\n\r\nI  added a new option for [`getter` functions](https://github.com/mattip/cython/commit/1e199bdab36f8246207b9b49bde74170096ee513#diff-f2a7ee9b7ea418a57c227021fd774abdR2870) inside `ctypedef class`, to support this. If it is a desired addition, I can flesh this out into a full PR with error checking and a test or two.\r\n\r\nI wanted to document this new syntax extension, but could not find documentation for specifying cname attributes in `ctypedef classes`. There are examples of `ctypedef` use [here](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/external_C_code.html?highlight=ctypedef#styles-of-struct-union-and-enum-declaration) and [here](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html?highlight=attribute#instantiation-from-existing-c-c-pointers) but neither use the attribute renaming like where python `ndims` becomes c `nd`. Where should/does this exist in the documentation?\r\n\r\n#### Changed defines like `NPY_WRITEABLE` -> `NPY_ARRAY_WRITEABLE`\r\nI could not find a way to gracefully warn rather than simply error and did not feel like creating another questionable cython hack without asking first. It would be nice to have a way to mark the old ones as `enum_deprecate` or so, to provide a path for upgrading without erroring\r\n\r\n### Pandas\r\n\r\nPandas has fast routines for reductions and windowing functions that require the old API (direct access to the data pointer as a LHS value). I simply degraded the API version to the old one. Compiled code still uses the newer getter syntax. Here is an example of cython code and how it is compiled to C:\r\n```\r\n /* \"pandas/_libs/reduction.pyx\":115\r\n *         chunk = self.dummy\r\n *         dummy_buf = chunk.data\r\n *         chunk.data = arr.data             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n *         labels = self.labels\r\n *         has_labels = labels is not None\r\n */\r\n  __pyx_t_2 = PyArray_BYTES(__pyx_v_arr);\r\n  PyArray_BYTES(__pyx_v_chunk) = __pyx_t_2;\r\n```\r\nIn pre-1.7 API  `PyArray_BYTES` is a macro not a function and so can be on the LHS.\r\n\r\nThere was no use of the deprecated enums in cython code, so the changes were all to simply allow the old API.\r\n\r\n### Scipy\r\n\r\nIt was tedious but relatively painless to convert scipy to use the newer APIs. I found no places where code could not be converted. But after a few hours of sed replacement of `var->data` with `PyArray_DATA(var)`and such I began to ask more existential questions about code churn and why we need this.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI am not sure how I feel about all of this. Adopting the new API in cython will cause a lot of churn for downstream users. On the one hand this is water under the bridge, as @rgommers said the \"new\" API was released with NumPy 1.7 in Feb 2013. On the other hand, it is hard to see how the changes\r\n- enums, which replace `NPY` with `NPY_ARRAY`\r\n- attribute hiding of `PyArrayObject` attributes behind getter functions\r\ncontribute to the advancement of NumPy as stated in its [scope](http://www.numpy.org/neps/scope.html) as an \"in-memory, N-dimensional, homogeneously typed (single pointer + strided) array\". \r\n\r\nI am left with more questions than answers:\r\n- Is there interest in the approach to getter functions for attributes in `ctypedef class`es in cython?\r\n-  Is there interest in a cython `enum_deprecated` extension to warn of renamed enums (I assume it is possible, but is it a good thing)?\r\n- Any opinions, as language designers and experienced developers, about the advantages of hiding `struct` attributes behind getter functions, and how necessary it is?\r\n- How annoying is it to put an enormous text block as the 21st comment on an issue tracker?\r\nThis is not the correct forum for the discussion of the future of the NumPy API but I wanted to put this out there.",

            "body": "1) Some kind of deprecation marker would be nice to have, so that Cython could warn about usages.\r\n2) I like the feature of \"C-ish properties\" that map to C function calls or macros, although they would obviously be read-only (even if they return references in C++). Worth a separate feature ticket first, to discuss idea and syntax proposals. At a quick glance, your experiment doesn't look too bad.\r\n\r\nI can't really say much about the NumPy API evolution. That is definitely something to discuss inside of the NumPy project. There's currently a similar drive amongst the CPython devs: hide details to regain dev freedom. I can't say if this is really bound to lead anywhere good, but since it breaks the world, I think it's at least worth a very good motivation. And it's difficult to collect numbers without breaking and fixing the world first. That makes it a pretty big chicken crawling out of its own egg there. And, you know, developer time is a scarce resource and all that …\r\n\r\nThat being said, if Cython itself stops relying on the deprecated NumPy API, then users get at least a chance for removing the deprecated usages on their side. You showed that that's not always easy, but at least it's now possible, after #2559 was mostly applied in 222334c0b91eae41de2af2692daec6183cdaf243.",
