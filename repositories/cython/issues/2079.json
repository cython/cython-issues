I.e., if you write this:\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from \"abc.h\": ...\r\nctypedef int huhu\r\ncdef extern from \"xyz.h\": ...\r\n```\r\nthen `abc.h` would be an early include and `xyz.h` would be a late include that could thus make use of `huhu` and also the declarations in `abc.h`. That way, it is at least visible in the code what goes on. I think it would still be ok in that case to only have two places where includes are generated, and disallow any complex interleaving for now. That could still be added later if truly necessary.",
