After I found [this page from Pyrex's docs](https://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/version/Doc/Manual/basics.html#mozTocId899067), I think it's referring to this kind of Pyrex loop:\r\n\r\n    for 0 <= i < n: \r\n        ...\r\n\r\nShould this be changed to something like the following?\r\n\r\n> You can use Pyrex's `for 0 <= i < n` syntax too\r\n\r\nI'm happy to submit the PR if so.",

See test cases: https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/tests/run/forfrom.pyx, https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/tests/run/for_from_float_T254.pyx, https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/tests/run/addloop.pyx.\r\n\r\nI don't know the full history, but I wonder if the `varname from` was made optional at some point. The documentation could be made clearer to cover both varieties of \"old-style\" loops, but my opinion is the important bit is the recommendation of what you should use (which is clear). My opinion is pretty unimportant of course :)\r\n\r\nMaybe submit a PR for something like:\r\n\r\n> You can use Pyrex's `for [i from] 0 <= i < n` syntax too\r\n\r\nwhich would be more correct, without getting into distracting detail about \"not recommended\" section",
