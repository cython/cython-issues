Please describe.\n\nCan't print cppclass objects.\r\n\r\ntest.pyx:8:6: Cannot convert 'test' to Python object\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nIt would be great being able to print a cppclass object like a struct for debugging purposes.\r\nThis would allow me to replace structs with cppclasses, add methods and overloads to it, and heap allocate it using new and delete which would be pretty helpful.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
