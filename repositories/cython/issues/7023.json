They are missing in earlier versions.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\nAnything that uses the pre-Py3.13 PyMutex implementation, probably just:\n```cython\nimport cython\ndef use_mutex():\n    cdef cython.pymutex mutex\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\nPyPy 3.10 v7.3.19, PyPy 3.9 v7.3.16\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt seems that only Py3.11 is still maintained (it's the only version released for PyPy 7.3.20), so the missing names are unlikely to become available in older PyPy Python versions any more.",
