Many of our classes are defined in private modules but exposed to users in public modules. We therefore set the `__module__` dunder to the public location.\n\nThis might be related to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3873.",

That uses a different way of creating cdef classes. I don't think there's any reason not to do that though (at least if you're using a fairly recent Python - there's a few bugs in Py3.8 era but I expect you've long ago dropped that)",
