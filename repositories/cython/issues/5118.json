I see there is this information available on how to do that https://github.com/github/renaming\r\n\r\nI tried to search if this request is already available/reported but sorry could not find it here.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n**Note:**\r\n- DO NOT use the bug and feature tracker for general questions and support requests.\r\n  Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n  It has a wider audience, so you get more and better answers.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already?\r\n  Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release?\r\n  It might already have what you want to report.\r\n  Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n",
