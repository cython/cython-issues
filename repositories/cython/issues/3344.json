For example:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60003504/73665811-af899400-46dc-11ea-900a-502f19c26bb3.png)\r\nThe attribute of \"score\" seems not the c-int type, so that cython cannot speed up the relevant codes in the later calculation. Similarly, when I define a numpy-ndarray attribute in a python class, I cannot use cython to speed up for the same reason.\r\n",
