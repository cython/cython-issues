    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWith the increase of the pace of Python releases, we have to recompile and make available wheels much more frequently. It would be nice if we could use the [PEP 652](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0652/) stable/limited API so wheels can be (re)used for future Python versions.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWhen PEP 652 stable API becomes available (if it isn't already!?), it would be nice if Cython offered a setting (if it didn't by default) to enable using only the limited API, so that I could compile a wheel for the current Cython versions and that wheel could be used for all future 3.x Python versions as described in the PEP.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n[PEP 652](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0652/) is not yet implemented I think, but it was [accepted recently](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/IN4XMFLQJ6D6V67EXU27GV3QWSEHHNNH/). But I'm not sure if y'all are aware of it so I would like to start a discussion about it, if this is something Cython can support.\r\n\r\nObviously python/pip would somehow need to [add support for this first](https://discuss.python.org/t/packaging-support-for-pep-652/8263), so that it can install 3.x compiled wheel under stable API to 3.x+1. But when that happens it would be nice if cython could support it as well.",
