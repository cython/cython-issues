    "body": "The current documentation stems mostly from a time when Pure Python Mode wasn't even being thought of and aims to present the special `cdef` syntax that Cython uses. The Pure Python Syntax is only presented on the [pure Python tutorial page](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html).\r\n\r\nToday, more and more new users come from a Python background that uses type annotations. We should accommodate them by presenting both syntax variants hand in hand throughout the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out, please do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Grab a documentation page and duplicate the code examples into separate files, inlcuding the Pure Python variant *before* the `cdef` variant with `literalinclude`. See \r\nThis currently excludes the pages that refer to the integration of external C or C++ code, since some of the required language features are not available in Pure Python code/mode (and this should be mentioned in those places).\r\n\r\nFor example, a file `add1.pyx`:\r\n```cython\r\ncdef int add1(int x) except -1:\r\n    return x + 1\r\n```\r\nshould be accompanied by a file `add1.py`:\r\n```cython\r\n@cython.exceptval(-1)\r\ndef add1(x: cython.int):\r\n    return x + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Read the surrounding text to see if there is anything that refers to the specific syntax constructs. Make sure everything is well explained to the readers so that they can easily understand the two examples.\r\n\r\n3) Put a paragraph near the top of the page to show a reference to `import cython` and briefly explain the difference between the two syntax variants:\r\n```\r\n.. include::\r\n    ../two-syntax-variants-used\r\n```\r\nThis includes the following text:\r\n```\r\nThis page uses two different syntax variants: the Cython specific ``cdef`` syntax\r\nand static Cython type declarations in :ref:`pure Python code <pep484_type_annotations>`,\r\nfollowing `PEP-484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_ type hints\r\nand `PEP 526 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/>`_ variable annotations.\r\nTo make good use of the latter, including C data types etc., you need\r\nthe special ``cython`` module, which you can import with\r\n\r\n.. code-block: python\r\n\r\n      import cython\r\n\r\nin the Python module that you want to compile.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon't forget to link back to this issue in any PRs that you submit.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Decisions/approaches taken further down:\r\n\r\n- use different file extensions for the two variants: `some_example.py` and `some_example.pyx`\r\n- present both in tabs to make it easy to switch between them\r\n- present the Python syntax variant tab before (left of) the Cython syntax, as the first will eventually become preferable\r\n- keep both source files aligned line by line to highlight the differences on tab switches\r\n- run the .py variant also through Python for syntax/sanity checking (find a way to deal with pure Python cimports)\r\n- automatically add `import cython` to the .py test files in `runtests.py` to avoid having to repeat it in all examples that need it\r\n- explicitly write `import cython` in test examples that are long enough (and need it), especially if they use future imports or directive comments\r\n- see https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4187#issuecomment-860123077 for further conventions\r\n\r\nList of files to consider:\r\n\r\n\r\n- [Getting Started](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/index.html) (#4283)\r\n    -

In a future world, where Python type annotations are established, new Python users learn them as part of the language, and Cython employs them for adapting code to data types – will it still be a good idea to have a `_pure` suffix for the files that use that syntax? I think not.\r\n\r\nIt's like the question whether code that needs to adapt to Py2/Py3 should base its decisions on a flag `IS_PY2` or `IS_PY3`. Once Py4 comes out, `IS_PY3` will probably be misleading. `IS_PY2` will never be.\r\n\r\nIf we add a marker to the file names, then I suggest doing it either for both variants or for the Cython syntax variant.",

The tests in `tests/run/` get compiled and executed.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything we need to special-case about tests, it's usually done with tags (e.g. `# tag: warning` for tests that produce certain compiler warnings).\r\n\r\nWe are free to decide how we want to deal with `.py` files under `tests/examples/`.

To include warning to rst:\r\n```rst\r\n.. include::\r\n    ../cimport-warning\r\n```\r\n\r\n5) Example for \"present both in tabs to make it easy to switch between them\" from ticket:\r\n```rst\r\n.. tabs::\r\n    .. group-tab:: Pure Python\r\n\r\n        .. literalinclude:: <path-to-file>\r\n            :linenos:\r\n\r\n    .. group-tab:: Cython\r\n\r\n        .. literalinclude:: <path-to-other-file>\r\n            :linenos:\r\n```\r\n\r\n6) Tip: first make sure the new Pythonised code works and passes all tests, then add to the documentation!",

Note, though, that it can also be confusing to mix, say, `cython.int` and plain `float` in the same example. People might consider this a documentation bug and read over it. Or, worse, send a PR to fix it.\r\n\r\nWe should try to keep the examples consistent and free of frowns and surprises. They also should serve as good examples for readers how code *should* be written, more than how code *could* be written.\r\n\r\n\r\n> It's a bit ugly having to use the Shadow.py types, but there is good reason!\r\n\r\nYeah, there is. I would still be happy if we could use the pre-3.0 time to sort out at least a bit of that ugliness. Subtle differences will always lead to unintended code behaviour and bugs for some users out there.",
