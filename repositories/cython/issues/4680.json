See https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/46029#issuecomment-1066294846\r\n\r\nI'm putting https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/f00af64bcc2cef4c3fb1433ed670ab5f9970e2cd as the most likely cause, but I haven't properly bisected it yet.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI don't have a tested minimal example myself yet, but I imagine\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef class C:\r\n   pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI'm not sure how far we should guarantee the long-term stability of our pickle output. 3.0 seems a reasonable time to break if, if we're going to. I wonder if we should have some way of ignoring the checksum though, just to help people preserve their old data.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Cython version 0.29.28 and 3.0 master (plus some in-progress patches)\r\n",
