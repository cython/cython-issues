    "body": "Have really enjoyed using the pure Python mode annotation support that Cython provides. It has been really great being able to optimize code while still being to engage with other devs in Python.\r\n\r\nWhile most things are already supported in some form or another, there have been a couple things that are missing. One is being able to annotate module variables.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn particular I'd like to type `x` and have that type used later in the code. AFAICT Cython currently treats `x` as an `object` instead of a `double`. This also means later code needs to coerce both variables into Python or C types before computing the result.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nx: double = 5.0\r\n\r\ndef add_y(y: double) -> double:\r\n    return x + y\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIdeally annotation like that shown above would result in a variable (like `x`) being typed as a C `double`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nCython has other pure Python acceptable code like `cython.declare`. AFAICT writing code using `declare` does seem to work correctly at the global level.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython import declare\r\n\r\ndeclare(x=double)\r\n\r\nx = 5.0\r\n\r\ndef add_y(y: double) -> double:\r\n    return x + y\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNA",

            "body": "I think the reason for not doing so is that it changes `x` from a public attribute of the module to something that's only visible from Cython within the module. For most users that would be quite a dramatic change to happen just because they have an annotation.\r\n\r\nWith that said, there should possibly be an option to turn it on for people who want to use module annotations.\r\n\r\nIt might also be possible to make the attribute typed and public with pep562 so that the external interface wouldn't need to change (for people who are using newer Python versions)",
