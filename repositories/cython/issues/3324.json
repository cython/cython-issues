    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIn `cython-mode`, some of the mechanic is subcontracted to one of the existing `python-mode`'s. I am not sure how all of those interact, but at least with the built-in `python.el`, there could be some improvement to parsing.\r\n\r\nFor example, currently, `python-info-docstring-p` fails to recognize that the point is in the docstring of a `cdef` or `cpdef`, which in turns means that formatting settings such as auto-filling fail.\r\n\r\nI believe that `cython-mode` should provide a new value for `python-nav-beginning-of-defun-regexp`, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(setq-local python-nav-beginning-of-defun-regexp \r\n\t      (python-rx line-start\r\n\t\t\t (* space)\r\n\t\t\t (and symbol-start\r\n\t\t\t      (or \"def\" \"class\"\r\n\t\t\t\t  (and \"async\" (+ space) \"def\")\r\n\t\t\t\t  ;; new\r\n\t\t\t\t  (and (or \"cdef\" \"cpdef\") (+ space) (* (any word ?_))))\r\n\t\t\t      symbol-end)\r\n\t\t\t (+ space)\r\n\t\t\t (group symbol-name)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to do the trick for me, but I'm probably using only a subset of cython's syntax.",
