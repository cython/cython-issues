            "body": "First of all, I agree that inferring the item type(s) of containers (especially when they are declared via PEP-484 typing) would be nice, and there's probably already a hugely outdated ticket for that which was written years before PEP-484. Cython's support for PEP-484 typing is definitely still young and in flux. It will have to mature over time. Feedback is always appreciated, as it allows us to see actual use cases that we can improve.\r\n\r\nRegarding your example, inferring `float` would be helpful, since it can be safely aliased to C `double`. But that's the special case. If the type was `int`, it wouldn't help, since Cython cannot safely map Python ints to any fixed size C integer type. You could use `cython.int` or `cython.long` for that, though, which request specific C integer semantics.\r\n\r\nRegarding `str` keys, there is no speed advantage to be gained for the loop you showed, and as Robert suggested, iterating only over `d.values()` generates much more efficient code already - if that suits your real use case. But also in other cases, `str` means \"`str` or a subtype\" in Python, but Cython can only make use of \"exactly `str`\" for optimisation, as subtypes can override the builtin type behaviour in arbitrary and unpredictable ways. If you type a variable as `cdef str k` in Cython, it will actually reject subtypes on assignment, for exactly that reason. That's why we currently ignore PEP-484 style annotations of type `str`. They simply don't have sufficiently tight semantics, similar to the `int` issue above.\r\n\r\nThe same subtyping issue applies also to a `Dict` annotation vs. `cdef dict d`, but this is again a special case that could be exploited at least for looping. The runtime special casing code is already mostly there as we apply an optimistic optimisation whenever we see code that loops over `something.items()` etc., which has a very high probability of `something` turning out to be exactly a `dict` in practice.",

My objective is to retain Python interpretability while still gaining some Cython speedups, so the PEP-484 style annotations are quite attractive. I think I read that for `cython.int` I can also accomplish this by using `int` and providing a declaration as a file-level comment.

Their interpretation by Cython should not conflict with their meaning in Python code.\r\n\r\nI think, what we could do at some point, is to automatically generate fused types for builtin Python types, so that `int` would be aliased as a fused type of all (relevant) C integer types and `object`, and `str` etc. would be an alias for \"`str` or `object`\". Meaning, we would optimise the code for the expected case, and generate a generic fallback implementation for the case of arbitrary subtypes. That would give you quite a bit of code explosion (because `int` wouldn't necessarily be the same for different variables, so you'd end up with the cross product of all declared types), and (sadly) also slower function calls due to the intermediate dispatch, but it would allow to optimise the code in functions while still keeping up full Python compatibility.\r\n\r\nWe could also extend the meaning of the `infer_types=True` compiler directive to infer PEP-484/526 annotations with C semantics where possible. Without that option, we only infer safe types that do not break Python semantics. Currently, if this option is enabled, Cython is already free to assume that an inferred expression like `C int + C int` does not overflow and should result in a C `int`. Cython could then infer an `int` annotation as meaning `C long`.",

But also in other cases, str means \"str or a subtype\" in Python, but Cython can only make use of \"exactly str\" for optimisation, as subtypes can override the builtin type behaviour in arbitrary and unpredictable ways. If you type a variable as cdef str k in Cython, it will actually reject subtypes on assignment, for exactly that reason. That's why we currently ignore PEP-484 style annotations of type str. They simply don't have sufficiently tight semantics, similar to the int issue above.\r\n\r\nI actually do care about accelerating `dict.__getitem__` or `dict.get`, and not just iterating over dict values.  In my case my objects are definitely Python strings, and not subtypes.  I would be happy to annotate with `k: cython.str` if necessary.",

But it turned out to be slower for me, so undid the change later. Can't say why, so if you want to give it a try on your side, you could at least confirm that this is not worth pursuing. You'll have to use `cdef` typing on the string key variable or the decorator `@cython.locals(xyzkey=str)` to trigger it (you should see calls to `..._GetItemUnicode` in the C file). It suggests to me that typing as `str` is probably not worth it for lookups.",
