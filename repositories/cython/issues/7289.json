It might be something that the C++ compiler could take care of while inlining the code, though, so maybe it's a hypothetical issue.\n\nIt's definitely possible to express in C++ with something like `noexcept(noexcept(arg1 == arg2))`, although the `std::vector` comparison operators are not specified like that.  I'm not sure that's something to bring into Cython though: it's fairly complicated C++ syntax and relies on us knowing everything that the C++ compiler does.\n\nBut if it was there it should be visible to the C++ compiler.",
