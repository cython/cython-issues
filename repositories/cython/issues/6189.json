A large part of the cpu time is spend doind ffts, so I've included the possibility to use pyfftw directly instead of numpy or scipy.\r\nLet me stress this point: pyfftw is a **compulsory** build dependency, but only an **optional** runtime dependency of this project.\r\n\r\nin the *.pyx file, the corresponding imports are protected by a try block:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ntry:\r\n    import pyfftw as p_pyfftw   \r\n    cimport pyfftw\r\n    PYFFTW_AVAILABLE = True\r\nexcept:\r\n    PYFFTW_AVAILABLE = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompilation and runtime tests when pyfftw is installed go as expected.\r\nWhen it is not, I get a runtime error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyfftw'`.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n# example code\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNo `ModuleNotFoundError` if the module is not available at runtime.\n\n### OS\n\nWSL2 Ubuntu 20.04\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.2\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.10\n\n### Additional context\n\nI doubt this is relevant, but I'm using a forked version of pyfftw that is not yet merged in the main project.\r\nThe point of the PR is to allow calls to fftw from cython in a nogil environment.\r\nCf https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW/pull/375 for the pull request.\r\nThis version can be installed with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install pyfftw@git+ssh://git@github.com/gabrielfougeron/pyFFTW.git@84e58bdff277bb654b77df1fd20febfbbd1e5dd2\r\n```",

There's currently a lot of assumptions that we never have to check these pointers, and that cimports always happen first.\r\n\r\nSo it's currently expected behaviour that this doesn't work, and that probably isn't likely to change soon.",

Use the simple \"tempita\" templating system that's built into Cython. It's largely designed for our own use although we've been meaning to expose more publicly someday - but Scipy and Pandas both use it for this sort of purpose.  You'll have to do something custom to get them into your build process though but Pandas is probably a good place to copy. A few links to relevant files there:\r\n      https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/1df457fb530924e474f3c4e50c7659dc062a9ae3/generate_pxi.py#L7,\r\n      https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/1df457fb530924e474f3c4e50c7659dc062a9ae3/meson.build#L17,\r\n      https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/1df457fb530924e474f3c4e50c7659dc062a9ae3/setup.py#L93\r\n2. You could use the \"Conditional Compilation\" feature of the Cython language (https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#conditional-compilation). That's deprecated in that we intend to remove it at some point in the future, but not before we've got a well-tested and functional replacement (which isn't yet).\r\n\r\nOther different approaches to the problem that you could consider:\r\n* See if you can isolate use of PyFFTW to a single Cython module with a public interface consisting only of Python importables (e.g. not having to call any `cdef` functions. Then you could just `import` that module and you wouldn't have to `cimport` it.\r\n* Inheritance, where you have a `cdef class` that implements the public interface (and optionally the fallback implementation), and a derived `cdef class` in a separate file that implements the PyFFTW version. Since you only use it  through the base class interface you only need to `cimport` the base file, and you can plain `import` the derived one.\r\n* Something involving getting access to the FFTW functions via `PyCapsule`s carrying function pointers. I don't really recommend this, but again, it lets you pass them across a purely Python interface.",
