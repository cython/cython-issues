The comment at the top of `posix/types.pxd` actually suggests that we might end up with a (slight) performance and usability regression if we replace `long` by `long long`, due to generally larger types being handled and potential changes to the conversion functions being used.\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/16994b9df3461b1a6f4e5971ab8a7b72f2a4b006/Cython/Includes/posix/types.pxd#L1-L11\r\n\r\nSo, not sure what to do here. The declarations are actually ok and work, but the question is what users expect. If they want to be platform independent, they need to either use `time_t` and friends in their code, or use `long long` to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems best to use `time_t` also in user code. That's what the typedef is there for, and it's explicitly marked as platform specific in the Posix specs. Relying on it being either `long` or `long long` seems to produce more problems than it solves.",

Cython does not even need to know all fields in the struct, it's happy if you declare those that the code uses.\n\n\n>My errors seems to have went away by changing the cython time_t type without touching pyfuse3 yesterday.\n\nI cannot comment on this because I do not know exactly how pyfuse3 uses the declarations.\n",
