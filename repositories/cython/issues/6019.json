Having a `__cinit__` with any arg produces code that gets a warning for\r\n> Array access (from variable 'kwvalues') results in a null pointer dereference [core.NullDereference]\r\n\r\nI don't consider this a bug, because I wouldn't know how to trigger it, but I don't know the code well enough to know for sure.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal reproducer: https://github.com/black-sliver/scan-build-cython-test\r\nThe repo has a gh action run that has a report attached as artifact.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nProbably either not calling __Pyx_ParseOptionalKeywords when it makes no sense, or adding an extra null check, but I am really no expert on that matter.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n* `-disable-checker core.NullDereference`, but that kind of defeats the purpose.\r\n* Not using `__cinit__`. In the project I wanted to implement this, we actually ended up not using `__cinit__`, so this doesn't have the highest priority *for me*.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
