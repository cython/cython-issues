Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[GraalPython](https://github.com/oracle/graalpython) is an alternative Python implementation. If I understand it correctly it's an implementation of Python that works/compiles to a Java virtual machine, and supports C extensions by executing LLVM bytecode. (My understanding is sketchy though...).\r\n\r\nIt claims to support some of Numpy and Pandas, which suggests that it can run some Cython extensions. Therefore it might be an idea to test/support it on a similar basis to PyPy.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n* Do nothing (the status quo),\r\n* Gently prod the maintainers of GraalPython into running the Cython tests instead.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n1. I don't know if anyone is actually using it (i.e. is it worth anyone's effort to support)\r\n2. It probably shouldn't be considered until the Travis->Github actions migration is finished/understood\r\n3. I know nothing about this personally (even how to install GraalPython locally to try it), and wasn't planning on doing it myself, so have created the issue in case it was of interest to someone else.",
