Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe `cython.cfunc` decorator is applied not just to the function that is decorates, but to all enclosed functions. This causes a compiler crash.\r\n\r\nI suspect that there's other decorators that this applied to as well (e.g. `cython.returns`, `cython.cclass`, etc). I haven't made a thorough check of these yet though.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\n@cython.cfunc\r\ndef f():\r\n    def inner():  # should not be a cfunc\r\n        pass\r\n    return inner\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message ends with \r\n```\r\nCython/Compiler/ParseTreeTransforms.py\", line 2783, in create_class_from_scope\r\n    if not node.py_cfunc_node:\r\nAttributeError: 'CFuncDefNode' object has no attribute 'py_cfunc_node'\r\n```\r\n(but I don't think this is actually hugely useful to the bug)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`f` should be a `cdef` function, `inner` should be a regular function.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Python version: 3.8.8\r\n - Cython version: current master branch\r\n",
