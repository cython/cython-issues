NumPy fails the builds on warnings.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nWe are seeing this in NumPy when [building for Python 3.11](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21308#issuecomment-1091193532).\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. Linux, Windows, macOS]\r\n - Python version [e.g. 3.8.4]\r\n - Cython version [e.g. 0.29.18]\r\n\r\nAll OSs, Python 3.11alpha, Cython HEAD and 0.29.28\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nCython could decide to tell downstream projects to ignore the deprecation warning, which would allow the problem to be pushed off for 2 years.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to avoid the fast path that uses internals. Would it be a significant slowdown to skip this for Python>=3.11? https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/c79ae55a7440459dae7667699284a72b09e89185/Cython/Utility/StringTools.c#L369-L379",
