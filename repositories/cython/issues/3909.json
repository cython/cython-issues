(`cdef bytes b = data`, where `data` is a `char*`). Calling `float()` would essentially do the same thing, just automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid creating the intermediate `bytes` creation, I suggest using the more low-level function [`PyOS_string_to_double()`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/conversion.html#c.PyOS_string_to_double), which seems perfect for your purpose.
