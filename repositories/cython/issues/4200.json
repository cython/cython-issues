Unfortunately with Pyston this memory corruption is not fixed by disabling the gc during `PyType_Ready` because of the additional fields we need to initialize as pointed out above (but we also need the `gc.disable` code or we would likely run into the same issue as cpython).\r\nI tried using setting `CFLAGS=-DCYTHON_USE_TYPE_SPECS=1` during pip install (with disabled cache to make sure it recompiles) but this did not help I'm not sure if this flag got picked up. But if this causes some other incompatibilities it's not really a good solution for us because we want to support same stuff as cpython. So maybe special casing this cases in pyston is needed - I'm just not really sure how to do it...\r\n",
