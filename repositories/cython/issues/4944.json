This matters on Python 2 because it rejects `long`. Was this intended?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\ndef f(x: int):\r\n  return x+1\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen from python 2\r\n```python\r\nimport testmod\r\ntestmod.f(1)  # works\r\ntestmod.f(long(1))  # fails\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Python version: 2.7\r\n - Cython version: current master branch\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nObviously this is the long-term plan, but I'm not sure we meant to do it now?\r\n\r\nAlso, whether or not it's supported we probably need some test coverage",
