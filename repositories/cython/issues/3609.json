    "body": "I think assigning to a struct member should be treated like assigning to the struct as a whole regarding data sharing mode.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, `tid` is made private in the parallel block, `s` isn't, and both values disagree.\r\n```cython\r\nimport time\r\nfrom cython import parallel\r\n\r\n\r\ncdef struct mystruct:\r\n    int tid\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    cdef int tid\r\n    cdef mystruct s\r\n\r\n    with nogil, parallel.parallel():\r\n        tid = parallel.threadid()\r\n        s.tid = parallel.threadid()\r\n\r\n        with gil:\r\n            time.sleep(1)\r\n            print(\"tid = %d, s.tid = %d\" % (tid, s.tid))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe workaround is pretty simple, assign `s` as a whole with `s = mystruct(0)` and then change its members as needed.\r\n\r\nThe situation seems to be even worse with python objects although I have no use-case for it.",
