Please describe.\n\nIt can sometimes happen that Cython infers a C type for a value or variable, but then all usages require a Python object and generate separate object conversion code. There are probably cases where this could be detected and avoided.\n\nThis specifically applies to types with an equivalent C type that we try to prefer:\n- Python `bool` -> `bint` (which, luckily, is a cheap conversion)\n- Python `float` -> C `double`\n- ctuples\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I suspect this is hard to implement generally.\n* Possibly change how we interpret annotations to avoid it (e.g. an annotation of `float` is currently interpreted as \"C double\" but in principle we could pick either \"C double\" or \"Python float\" and we'd still be respecting the annotation).
