With compiling I mean to convert the Python modules into C files, compiling them and statically linking the resulting objects into one executable. This results in 1 executable for the whole application (and not a shared library per module (which could be hundreds in my case)).\r\n\r\nI am using cython_freeze.py to create the main entry point.\r\nBut cython_freeze.py can not handle packages\r\n\r\nSo I implemented a simple workaround in cython_freeze   (by renaming the subpackages). I know that this is not perfect, but my understanding of Cython inner working is not good enough to come up with a full solution (that handles identical named modules and __init__.py).\r\n\r\nMaybe someone is interested in implementing a full solution  (I am willing to share my changes of course).\r\n\r\nNB: A solution could also be to compile each sub package into it's own shared objects (ie a .so or .dll). This would require cython_freeze.py to create the  DLL or .SO  startup code  (instead of main).\r\n   \r\n",

However I think they target making a large bundled .so file rather than an application.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit sceptical of the usefulness of trying to build a self-contained application Cython files. The real problem is if you use any third-party modules then you have to bundle them too, and that seems to be quite a hard problem. Personally I'd rather recommend a dedicated solution (e.g. cx_freeze, pyinstaller, nuitka) than try to support it poorly in Cython.\r\n\r\nI think modest improvements to the cython_freeze demo script would be welcome. I'd be reluctant to go much further mainly because I'm not personally interested in supporting the full tool that can handle any dependency. Other Cython maintainers may feel differently though (I suspect they don't, but I don't know for sure...).",
