After this change, our enumerations suddenly became iterable and things broke (vapoursynth/vapoursynth#1046).\r\n\r\nIt's understandable why the switch to `IntFlag` was made and we've worked around it but I would love if you could optionally signal plain `IntEnum` behavior outside of C++ context.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @JustinTArthur in https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4877#issuecomment-2038220470_\r\n            \r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDW's notes:\r\n\r\n* It probably isn't too a hard to implement from a code-gen point of view it's just a case of finding a nice syntax. Probably just a decorator on `cpdef enum`?\r\n\r\n* We're obviously slightly at the mercy of what CPython decides to do with their enums. `IntFlag` wasn't actually iterable until 3.11 (which is admittedly after we started using it) so this change to behaviour is only *partly* of our own doing.\r\n\r\n* I'm not hugely convinced it's worth the extra complication right now.",
