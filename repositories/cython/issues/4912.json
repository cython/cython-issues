I'm currently maintaining patches to Cython for compatibility. If the Cython maintainers are OK with it, I'll submit PRs for compatibility.\r\n\r\nThere are two pieces, both pretty small:\r\n- The configuration in `Cython/Utility/ModuleSetupCode.c`\r\n- Making `MemoryView` reference counting thread-safe without the GIL\r\n\r\nMaking Cython compatible with \"nogil\" Python will make it easier to install Python packages that depend on Cython.
