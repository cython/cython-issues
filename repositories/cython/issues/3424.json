A `.py` (and maybe `.pyx`? IDK.) module file can't be `cimport`ed without a `.pxd` file. It'd be congruent for a package, usually defined by a `__init__.py` file, to also require an `__init__.pxd` (which would have all the typing and other C-level information necessary for static compilation).\r\n\r\nNote that it is possible to do regular `import`s; they just have to go through CPython and don't get optimized AFAICT. It also works fine to `cimport` the modules inside of a package without an `__init__.pxd` file in the package (e.g. `from cypkg.cysubpkg cimport cymodule`), but doing a `cimport` on the package itself requires `__init__.pxd` IIRC.",
