NumPy has been experimenting with adding that architecture to our build matrix. Would there be interest in integratiing this into cython so we could get arm wheels on PyPI? The work on NumPy is numpy/numpy#11702. @jjhelmus is also trying this on Scipy and has a yml file that may be of interest.",

Basically, we want to compile Cython (preferably in parallel, e.g. `setup.py build_ext -i -j4`), then build a wheel, then run the tests (see `make test`, but preferably also in parallel with `-j`). Finally, upload to the same place as the wheel builds, if possible.\r\n\r\nOur travis CI setup (not the wheels build) uses separate build jobs for the C and C++ tests through a build matrix, which leads to a much faster turn-over, but for the wheel builds, we'd have to take care that we don't upload twice if we enable that. Also, disabling C compiler optimisations (`CFLAGS=\"-O0\"`) when running the tests speeds them up a lot.",
