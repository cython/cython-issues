Finally, upload to the same place as the wheel builds, if possible.\r\n\r\nOur travis CI setup (not the wheels build) uses separate build jobs for the C and C++ tests through a build matrix, which leads to a much faster turn-over, but for the wheel builds, we'd have to take care that we don't upload twice if we enable that. Also, disabling C compiler optimisations (`CFLAGS=\"-O0\"`) when running the tests speeds them up a lot.",
