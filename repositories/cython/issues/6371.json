It's hugely complicated (i.e. it introduces 3(?) new types of scopes with different behaviours to existing scopes) and for all that complication it doesn't really actually do anything.\r\n\r\nMy initial proposal is that we accept the syntax but don't do anything with it - possibly just get the parser to count square brackets until it reaches 0 again. We should probably also emit a warning saying we've done that.\r\n\r\nThat'd achieve the minimum aim of getting people's code compiling, and a better follow-up could be later.\r\n\r\nEven that is pretty low-priority in my mind though.",
