    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThe wheel for 3.1.2 that is installed with `pip install cython` causes an illegal instruction on the environment described in 'Additional context' when you try to cythonize anything. `pip install cython==3.1.1` fixes the problem as does `pip install .` in the cython source with the 3.1.2 tag checked out.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n[cython-test.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21419506/cython-test.tar.gz)\n\nIn a test directory:\n\n```\ntar xf cython-test.tar.gz  # The attached archive\ncd cython-test\npython -m venv pyenv\n. pyenv/bin/activate\npip install setuptools cython\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\n```\n\nThis creates a virtual environment, installs setuptools and cython and then attempts to build the Hello World example I plagiarised from the cython documentation.\n\nOn my environment cython dumps core with an Illegal Instruction.\n\nNow run:\n\n```\nrm -rf build helloworld.c*\npip install cython==3.1.1\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\n```\n\nThe build succeeds. Next:\n\n```\nrm -rf build helloworld.c*\ngit clone http://github.com/cython/cython\ngit -C cython checkout 3.1.2 && pip install ./cython\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\n```\n\nThis also succeeds.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nIdeally the standard wheel installed by `pip install cython` would not cause illegal instructions. \n\n### OS\n\nLinux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12.3\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.2\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe same problem occurs with 3.13.5, and the same workarounds also work with that version. The processor is an `AMD Phenom(tm) II X6 1090T Processor` which does not support modern vector extensions like SSE4 or AVX*. I have encountered illegal instruction problems in the past because pre-built binaries for some projects assume support for these things - although I don't know for sure that this is the problem here.\n\nThe flags as reported by /proc/cpuinfo are:\n\n```fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx mmxext fxsr_opt pdpe1gb rdtscp lm 3dnowext 3dnow constant_tsc rep_good nopl nonstop_tsc cpuid extd_apicid aperfmperf pni monitor cx16 popcnt lahf_lm cmp_legacy svm extapic cr8_legacy abm sse4a misalignsse 3dnowprefetch osvw ibs skinit wdt cpb hw_pstate vmmcall npt lbrv svm_lock nrip_save pausefilter```\n\nI also tested on a computer with an `Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     P8700  @ 2.53GHz` processor and the problem does not occur. The flags on that processor are:\n\n```fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht tm pbe syscall nx lm constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good nopl cpuid aperfmperf pni dtes64 monitor ds_cpl vmx smx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm sse4_1 xsave lahf_lm pti tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority dtherm```",
