Please describe.\r\n\r\n`Py_TPFLAGS_SEQUENCE` and `Py_TPFLAGS_MAPPING` were added in 3.10 and are the mechanism that pattern matching uses to decide if a class is a sequence or a mapping. Users may want to designate their cdef classes as one of these.\r\n\r\nThe usual Python mechanism for marking classes is to register them with `collections.abc.Sequence` (or `Mapping`). However this doesn't work for immutable classes (which cdef classes are/will be), because it refuses to change the type flags.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nAn additional decorator (e.g. `@cython.collection_type(\"sequence\")`) that applies this flag to a cdef class.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nNote that this is specifically useful for the Cython memoryview object wrapper (which we want to designate as a sequence). Whatever we do I believe we want a way to mark this as a sequence. My proposal is just to expose the feature to users too (since it may be more generally useful)\r\n\r\nLinked comment https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/5023#issuecomment-1244486158",
