Please describe.\n\nSimply adding shortcut for C breakpoints, which may trigger in CyGDB\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n\r\n# BREAKPOINT\r\n# a simple 2 lines, but may require more checking for OS-type\r\n# this works on linux\r\nfrom libc.signal cimport raise_, SIGTRAP\r\nraise_(SIGTRAP)\r\n\r\n# ASSERTION\r\ncdef extern from \"assert.h\":\r\n    # Replacing name to avoid conflict with python assert keyword!\r\n    void assert_ \"assert\"(bint)\r\n# This will raise C-style assert\r\nassert_(0)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nInstead of copy-pasting the code above, it would be great to have the following:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython.debugging import cyassert, cybreakpoint\r\n\r\ncpdef main():\r\n     cyassert(some_value, \"Incorrect value\")\r\n     \r\n     # Unconditionally break\r\n     cybreakpoint(1)\r\n\r\n     # Conditionally break\r\n     cybreakpoint( i == 100)\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nI've created a project, a toolkit for dealing with Cython. I might include the requested features in my project, but it would be great to have it included in main Cython.\r\n\r\nSimple example of how it could be:\r\nhttps://github.com/alexveden/cython-tools/blob/main/src/cython_tools/_cy_tools_samples/debugging/assertions.pyx\r\nhttps://github.com/alexveden/cython-tools/blob/main/src/cython_tools/_cy_tools_samples/debugging/breakpoint.pyx\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
