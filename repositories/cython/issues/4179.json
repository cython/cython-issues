Also surprising -- I thought a python script is always compilable by cython (or this used to be the case?).\r\n\r\nA workaround is\r\n```\r\nif False:\r\n from cython improt compiled as _is_compiled\r\n is_compiled = _is_compiled\r\nelse:\r\n is_compiled = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo maybe we just need to add some documentation about this workaround.",

When it comes to directives from the Cython module I think that can't be true - they're special-cased to override normal Python behaviour so you can definitely use them to make things that don't work.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3507 seems related but not quite the same.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced this issue is actually fixable though - `import cython` is treated as `cimport cython` and thus variables that come from it have a ctype",
