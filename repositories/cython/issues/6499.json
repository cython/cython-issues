Please describe.\n\nCurrently, there is the pure Python mode that allows programs to be written in Python-compatible syntax and runs mostly the same in Python versus compiled.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to have a way to \"de-cython\" some code in cython syntax so that it is runnable in Python interpreter â€” reason: cython extended syntax is nice, but compilation is slow. For prototyping it would be useful to be able to quickly iterate on the code.\r\n\r\nSo it could e.g. translate `cdef` function to `def`, etc. then run the result as typical Python code.\r\n\r\n(Caveat: integer overflows etc. will behave differently.)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
