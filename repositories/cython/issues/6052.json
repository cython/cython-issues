So passing it as an argument to a Python function and forcing a wrapper to be constructed on the fly sounds like something that I should have been discouraged from doing.\r\n\r\nYeah I kind of agree with this. Generally I think implicit type conversions are a mistake (for anything non-trivial), and we probably should have kept `cpdef` as the one way to do it.  In this case the issue is that you think you've avoided the overhead of a `def` function, but it's been implicitly added back.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the conversion is there it has to work reliably.",
