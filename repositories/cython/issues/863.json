How can we define a generic rule in Cython which makes both possible?\r\n\r\nShould the behaviour of \"var.shape\" e.g. depend on the requested return value? This means overloading on return value which is a non-trivial language change, though perhaps appropriate here.\r\n\r\nThoughts welcome!\r\n\r\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/302\r\n",
