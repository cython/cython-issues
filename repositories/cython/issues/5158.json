Therefore I'm trying again here.\r\n\r\nI've seen some activity that may hint toward an upcoming Cython 0.29.33 release. This release will include the depfile support. Meson included  native support for compiling Cython code and having support for depfiles would enable it to correclty rebuild the Cython artifacts when any of the dependencies change. SciPy is leading the way in the scientific Python community for a switch from setuptools to Meson as build system. The depfile support would simplify this transition.\r\n\r\nMeson is moving toward an 1.0 release at the beginning of December. It would be awesome if this release could come with Cython dependency tracking support. Is there an expected release date for Cython 0.29.33?  Is there anything that can be done to help with getting the release out of the door?\r\n",
