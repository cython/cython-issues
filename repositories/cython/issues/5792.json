Please describe.\r\n\r\nIn NumPy, we are trying to change the default integer to be `Py_ssize_t` (or equivalent), because `long` is really not very nice on windows 64bit at least.  (yes, there is an argument to be made to always use 64bit numbers, but...)\r\n\r\nSince `int` is also `long` in Cython for the same historic reasons, I wonder if it would make sense to have a switch that makes it be `Py_ssize_t` instead.\r\nThis would mean that in the long term, the NumPy default integer and Cython can align again (if you know you are running NumPy >=2.0).\r\n\r\nI think it would also reduce the number of latent bugs around large integers on windows, while updating code that needs to realign with NumPy, I noticed that in many cases changing the meaning of `int` would make sense, even if would not actually help much with the NumPy transition problem (since it doesn't matter w.r.t. to supporting both NumPy 1.x and 2.x).\r\n\r\nOne subtlety is that I think `int` conversion from Python currently converts more agressively than other integers (using `int()`/`tp_int` rather than `operator.index()`/`nb_index`  (although I am not sure that is actually intentional).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nI would expect this to be a per-file `# cython:` switch, if possible (one tricky thing may be `pyd` files?).\r\nEDIT: I would expect this would just fail on a Python 2 target.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

So if you so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from *:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    typedef Py_ssize_t my_big_int\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    ctypedef int my_big_int\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in C the typedef is for `Py_ssize_t`. However in Cython it's just \"an arbitrary int type\", and things like overflow and signedness are left to the C compiler. And Cython doesn't apply its special rules for `Py_ssize_t` (since it doesn't know the underlying C definition).\r\n\r\nI know that's not quite what you're asking for, but it may be useful related information.",
