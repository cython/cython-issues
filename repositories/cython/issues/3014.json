    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to use Cython to accelerate some slow, math-heavy code in a large existing project. Since the project doesn't use setup.py for dependencies, I would like to use the `cythonize` command line tool to build the cython binaries. This works well, but I am unable to figure out how to specify an include directory, to e.g. include Numpy header files. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have guidance? E.g. to fix this issue:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cythonize -a -i **/*.pyx -3\r\n\r\nCompiling math-heavy-routines.pyx because it changed.\r\n[1/1] Cythonizing math-heavy-routines.pyx\r\nrunning build_ext\r\nmath-heavy-routines.c:611:10: fatal error: 'numpy/arrayobject.h' file not found\r\n#include \"numpy/arrayobject.h\"\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\nerror: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1```\r\n",
