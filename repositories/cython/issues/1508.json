    "body": "I cannot successfully obtain a report of coverage for the Cython module [`dd.cudd`](https://github.com/johnyf/dd/blob/master/dd/cudd.pyx). I have:\n- followed the [Cython instructions for enabling coverage analysis](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/profiling_tutorial.html#enabling-coverage-analysis)\n- ensured that `coverage.py` with its [C extension](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.2/plugins.html) are installed, in order for the `Cython.Coverage` plugin to work.\n\nI am using `nosetests`---I do not know whether `nose` can cause additional difficulties.\n\nDirectory layout under `/path` roughly:\n\n```\ndd/\ntests/\n```\n\nNormally, I run `nosetests` within `tests/`, because I want to ensure that `nosetests` will import `dd` from `site-packages` (I have also tried the `-w` option of `nosetests`).\nI have tried running `nosetests` both inside the `tests/` directory, and above it.\n`nose` does not report any results for `cudd.pyx`.\n\nWhen `nose --with-coverage --cover-package=dd` runs under `tests/`, it creates a `.coverage` that mentions both a `/path/tests/dd/cudd.pyx` file (nonexistent), as well as the existing `/path/dd/dd/cudd.pyx`. For the existing file, `coverage report` complains that\n\n```\n/path/dd/dd/cudd.pyx   NotPython:\nCouldn't parse '/path/dd/dd/cudd.pyx' as Python source: 'invalid syntax' at line 20\n```\n\nAlso, manually editing the wrong path reported in `.coveragerc` produces again the above error.\n\nThese observations are with:\n- `cython == 0.25.1`\n- `nose == 1.3.7`\n- `coverage == 4.2`\n\nHow can I get coverage to be reported for Cython modules? It seems that this may be a problem both with paths that `coverage.py` reports, and with failure of `coverage.py` to parse Cython syntax. I am unsure whether this should be addressed by `cython` (e.g., in the `coverage.py` plugin `Cython.Coverage`), or by `coverage.py`, or both.\n\nMay have some relevance to #1461.\n",
