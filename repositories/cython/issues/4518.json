But if I have already done `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`, then in a second run with `--with-cython-coverage` the cache is not invalidated, nothing is rebuilt, and coverage is not enabled.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if we could introspect the cythonized output to determine if --with-cython-coverage was used, to make an informed decision about cache invalidation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/setup.py#L395",
