Especially the optimisation level and the enabled features can make a huge difference in compile time. The more module-wide a compiler applies its optimisations, the more it's prone to suffer from a large source file size.\r\n\r\n\r\n>     3. I have not measured performance for this file, but I chose to cythonize all modules indiscriminately for performance (if any) and code obfuscation, which might be useful in the future for certain scenarios, even though I am developing an open-source app.\r\n\r\nCode obfuscation has never been an important goal for us, and I doubt that PyQt frontend code is worth compiling to make it visibly faster.\r\n\r\nI'll close this ticket as a duplicate of https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4425 where we've discussed (and improved) the performance and source file size for large input files. Please try the Cython master branch (3.1) which should make at least _some_ difference here.",

And Python code is orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of code size than the same functionality spelled out in a binary module.\r\n\r\nI'd expect that there are also UI callback functions in that module but even there, it's unlikely that you'll have a measurable benefit from compiling them.
