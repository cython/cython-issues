    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nSo we had an aiohttp sprint on Saturday and a few participants (@markgreene74 and @ajsanchezsanz) hit a surprising issue that was causing crashes in our existing tests on their machines.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be a combination of several factors, one of which was that our packaging accidentally allowed a new pre-release to be pulled into the ephemeral build environment, that was released just 18 hours prior. But that's the only bug on our side.\r\nAn extensive trip down the rabbit hole led us to discover that Cython was causing this somehow.\r\nThis was only happening in tests and not a regular Python REPL, and only under some environments. It wasn't obvious that it was Cython at first and once it was brought up (thanks @bdraco), we were able to quickly verify it.\r\nBut it wasn't easy to think of a reproducer for the sprint participants who didn't work with Cython before. Plus, the REPL thing was throwing people off. At some point I realized that there's `pytest-cov` and made an educated guess that being run under Coveragepy, something gets messed up.\r\nAnd so, it was possible to confirm this with a regular Python run with Coveragepy, finally. The previous (stable) version of Cython works, but not the new alpha.\r\n\r\nThe repro is linked to the issue over in yarl. But I'm hoping to come up with a small reproducer: please, consider this issue a placeholder for that.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n# TBD\r\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nIt shouldn't \n\n### OS\n\nmacOS / GitHub Codespaces\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12.4\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.0a1\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/issues/1411 / https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/pull/1412",
