Please describe.\n\nClang has a tool called \"opt-viewer\" which gives annotated HTML with slightly cryptic notes about what optimizations it tried and succeeded/failed to do. Potentially a similar thing could be useful in Cython as well (either a different form of compile-time output, in addition to \"error\" and \"warning\" or as annotated HTML).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nPotentially this would be less useful for Cython than for C/C++ - a lot of C/C++ optimizations are prevented by subtle pointer aliasing rules and similar. For Cython it's much more likely to be \"you didn't type this variable\". So it might be a lot of effort for fairly little benefit.",
