Example:\r\n```\r\n  [1/129] Compiling Cython CXX source for _compute...\r\n  performance hint: pyarrow/_compute.pyx:380:39: Exception check will always require the GIL to be acquired. Possible solutions:\r\n        1. Declare the function as 'noexcept' if you control the definition and you're sure you don't want the function to raise exceptions.\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/actions/runs/6452131883/job/17513702248#step:6:3712\r\n\r\nThe warning is legitimate in itself (that is, the analysis is right), it's just that it produces no actual value for us, and we get hundreds of instances of this warning simply because it flags a very common and convenient construct in the Arrow Cython source code (that construct unpacks a C++ result-or-error type and raises a Python exception on error).\r\n\r\nSeveral complaints here:\r\n\r\n1. I skimmed through the docs and I haven't found how to disable the warning (in particular, it does not seem mentioned [here](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html?highlight=warning#warnings)). It should be possible to disable warnings selectively, because they otherwise can obscure other more important pieces of information.\r\n\r\n2. I also find weird that the warning message seems to introduce several \"Possible solutions\" but only one is displayed. Is the message truncated?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Cython version\r\n\r\n3.0.3\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Is the message truncated?\r\n\r\nNo. It's a template that can output different numbers of options depending on the context, and you're (correctly) only getting one. I suspect it's worth tweaking the grammar a bit in that case though.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt's obvious a bit tricky - we want the message to be visible (because otherwise nobody will benefit from it, and it is a slightly unintuitive performance change) but don't want it to be disruptive. I'd deliberately made it \"not a warning\" so it wouldn't trip with `-Werrors`. But maybe it could be a bit easier to turn off.\r\n\r\nThe other thing we could might be able to change is to only show it on implicitly `except *` functions, and to assume that people who've manually added `except *` know what they're doing and don't need to see it.",

What `GetResultValue` does is return a `T` if the `Result<T>` is successful, otherwise raise a Python exception.\r\n\r\nGiven that Cython needs explicit `cdef` declarations for C++ variables AFAICT, the alternative of calling `GetResultValue` from outside the `with nogil` block would be much more verbose (need to add an explicit `cdef` for the temporary `Result<T>`).\r\n\r\nWe literally have tens or perhaps more than a hundred snippets like this, so anything that makes the idiom more verbose would be a turnoff.\r\n\r\n(and, tangentially, `GetResultValue` is [defined in C++](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/ad26f3ff2348292be8d723be64f443553c3703f3/python/pyarrow/src/arrow/python/common.h#L63-L73) because Cython does not support defining C++ template functions AFAICT)",
