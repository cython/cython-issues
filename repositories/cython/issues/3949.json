Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWith the Cython code and the `setup.py` below, C compilation fails with errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\nct.c:1409:49: error: unknown type name '__pyx_t_double_complex'\r\nstatic PyObject *__pyx_f_2ct_func(CYTHON_UNUSED __pyx_t_double_complex __pyx_v_arg) {\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\n\r\ncdef func(arg: complex):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe setup.py:\r\n\r\n``` Python\r\nfrom setuptools import Extension\r\nfrom setuptools import setup\r\n\r\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\r\n\r\nsetup(\r\n    name=\"ct\",\r\n    ext_modules=cythonize(\r\n        Extension(\"ct\", sources=[\"ct.pyx\"]),\r\n        language_level=3,\r\n    ),\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI searched through the issues and documentation, and haven't been able to find anything specific to this problem.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSince `complex` is a built-in type, I'd expect that either the correct type name be generated, or if this is the correct type name, that it be properly defined before being referenced.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: I've reproduced this on MacOS 10.15.7 and Linux 2.6.32\r\n - Python versions 3.8 and 3.9\r\n - Cython versions 0.29.21 and 3.0a6\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n",
