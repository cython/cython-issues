    "body": "In Cython, `def func(list arg)` allows `arg` to be `None`. In Python's PEP-484 `typing` universe, `def func(arg: list)` excludes `None` and passing `None` requires the spelling `def func(arg: Optional[list])`.\r\n\r\nGiven that `Optional[…]` exists, we could change the type analysis of PEP-484 argument annotations to exclude `None` by default (i.e. interpret them as if `not None` was given), since this it is a common source of mistakes (see #2696).  The use of `Optional[]` would then be interpreted as `or None`.\r\n\r\nThis would probably not apply to variable annotations. While [PEP-526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) doesn't seem to mention the topic anywhere explicitly, it seems hard to prevent variables from being set to None, and it has a runtime impact to prevent that case. Also, it does not seem very useful to actively prevent users from setting variables to None.\r\n\r\nAlso note that there is the issue of subtypes, which Python typing allows but Cython typing rejects. This difference would probably remain.",
