    "body": "In Cython, `def func(list arg)` allows `arg` to be `None`. In Python's PEP-484 `typing` universe, `def func(arg: list)` excludes `None` and passing `None` requires the spelling `def func(arg: Optional[list])`.\r\n\r\nGiven that `Optional[â€¦]` exists, we could change the type analysis of PEP-484 argument annotations to exclude `None` by default (i.e. interpret them as if `not None` was given), since this it is a common source of mistakes (see #2696).  The use of `Optional[]` would then be interpreted as `or None`.\r\n\r\nThis would probably not apply to variable annotations. While [PEP-526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) doesn't seem to mention the topic anywhere explicitly, it seems hard to prevent variables from being set to None, and it has a runtime impact to prevent that case. Also, it does not seem very useful to actively prevent users from setting variables to None.\r\n\r\nAlso note that there is the issue of subtypes, which Python typing allows but Cython typing rejects. This difference would probably remain.",

This is because previously, `not None` was not allowed on `cdef` function arguments. Now it's intended to be the default.\r\n\r\nShould we make this fail on the caller side?\r\n```cython\r\ncdef func(x: list): ...\r\n\r\nfunc(None)\r\n```\r\nIt feels a bit mixed. Here, the developer is usually in charge of the calling code. User provided `None` values should be ruled out at this point. So there doesn't seem to be a strict requirement to change this into a runtime error.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?",

The type analysis converts explicit type references like `cython.int` to `c_int_type`, and it does the same for `int`, because it lacks the context whether C types are expected here. Thus, `Optional[int]` (which is ok and 'obviously' refers to a Python int) and `Optional[cython.int]` (which should be rejected) look really the same and cannot easily be distinguished. I think we might have to reject C types with `Optional[]` at an earlier stage, so that the type declaration stages can rely on valid type declarations already (or at least don't have to second-guess what the type declaration looked like in actual code).",
