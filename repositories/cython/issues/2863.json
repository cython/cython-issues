    "body": "I think Cython 3.0 would also be a good time to implement [PEP-563](\r\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) (\"Postponed Evaluation of Annotations\"). There already is a Cython code generator in `Cython.CodeWriter` that can be used to generate the expression string. This should be done somewhat late in the compiler pipeline since some optimisations can make use of the annotation information. It might be worth creating a separate transformation before the code generation.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done:\r\n- Implement a new transform `class SerialiseAnnotations(VisitorTransform)` in `ParseTreeTransforms.py`.\r\n- Give it visitor methods for all nodes that can have annotations (any `ExprNode`, and anything that has an `annotation` attribute in `Nodes.py`).\r\n- If the node has an annotation, serialise it using the code writer and replace the existing `node.annotation` with a `StringNode' (or `UnicodeNode` ?) that wraps the string value.\r\n- Add the new transform to the pipeline in `Pipeline.py`, rather late, before the final checks.\r\n- Extend the existing annotation related tests in `tests/run/` to cover the annotation string value. Add new tests for expressions that are not covered yet.",
