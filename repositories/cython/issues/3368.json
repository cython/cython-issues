The equivalent C code compiles without warnings unless you remove const from the variable (except for y being unused):\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct TestType {\r\n    char string[10];\r\n};\r\n\r\nvoid f(const struct TestType *x) {\r\n    const char *y = x->string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was compiled with `gcc test2.c -shared -fPIC -Wall -o test2.so`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the C code generated by Cython, the pointer if first assigned to an intermediate value (`__pyx_t_1`), which is declared as `char *`, which triggers a discarded-qualifiers warning.\r\n\r\nThis was done with Cython 0.27.3 and GCC 7.5.0",
