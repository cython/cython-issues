Cython does not support subinterpreters, thus do not work with an InterpreterPoolExecutor. \r\n\r\nImporting in a subinterpreter yields: \"ImportError: module Cython.Utils does not support loading in subinterpreters\". \r\n\r\nIt looks like a lot of work was already done in the past to prepare for subinterpreters, by implementing CYTHON_USE_MODULE_STATE.

I certainly wouldn't dismiss trying it in favour of waiting. \r\n\r\nBut in terms of two-phase init, we've done some restructuring so most data (except global `cdef` variables right now) is stored in a \"module state struct\" (in any compilation mode... There's just a single global variable instance of the struct most of the time). But the one thing we haven't done is implemented any of the module lookup mechanisms. \r\n\r\nSo I can absolutely promise that won't work right now.",
