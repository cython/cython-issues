It stems from the German word \"Meister\", which means \"someone who learned (and mastered) a capability\". Naming the \"master\" branch \"master branch\" means that it's the branch that aggregates all approved capabilities (or merged feature branches, if you prefer). I do not see a \"master-slave\" relation in this context, and the word \"slave\" doesn't seem to be used in the code base.",
