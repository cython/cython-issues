    "body": "Cython modules tend to be big (see #2102) and certain parts are the same for all modules. Especially in large installations, it would reduce the overall binary size to extract the shareable parts into a dedicated shared library that all modules link against.\r\n\r\nRandom notes:\r\n- Some internal types are already shared across modules, but their code is still duplicated across all modules. The first imported Cython module (of a given Cython version) registers it globally for all others, which will then not use their own implementations.\r\n- Cython can already extract its helpers into dedicated header files to reduce the build overhead. A shared library could be based on that.\r\n- Much of the performance of Cython code comes from inlined (and compile time streamlined) functions. Extracting those into a shared library would probably slow things down visibly, but could be a tradeoff.\r\n- Using a shared library adds quite some complexity. The library could be used globally for a Python installation (in which case it's unclear how to find it and which one to use if there are multiple), or local to an installed package. The latter is probably simpler but still requires some coordination on user side. A global library could come in as a separate package dependency that the Cython project could provide, but would introduce an exact version dependency based on the Cython version that a package was built with.\r\n- It is not entirely clear how to deal with the runtime linking here. A real shared library would have to be loaded together with the Cython module, i.e. there would have to be a way for the shared library loader to find it. It might be easier (and more portable) to use a Python extension module and explicitly import the code from there via capsules, in the same way that Cython currently imports its shared types from the first imported module.\r\n- Such a shared library would have to be complete in order to be usable by all Cython generated modules. It would thus be larger than what most single Cython modules (and even some small sets of Cython modules) actually need.\r\n- The potential gain is unclear. For large installations, there is certainly a gain even if only the shared types are extracted from each of the modules. However, large installations are rare. If a shared library is created on a per-package basis, there will still be a lot of duplication in a given Python installation.",

Start with `CythonFunction.c`, `Coroutine.c` and `AsyncGen.c`, potentially also the memoryviews support, but that is probably more difficult.\r\n- Add a new option `shared_module` to `cythonize()` that takes the qualified module name of a shared module to generate. For example, the `lxml` package would say something like `shared_module=\"lxml._cython_shared\"`.\r\n- Make Cython generate the shared module on request, by dropping _all_ the shared utility code into it, and also the code that exports them as the Cython ABI module (which already exists, see `ImportExport.c` and the related code snippets in the utility code files named above).\r\n- Make Cython exclude the shared code from all the other modules and instead only use the existing shared importing code (which is used to share types and functions across Cython modules that currently duplicate their implementations).\r\n- Don't forget to put a runtime version check into the sharing code to detect the case where only some of the modules in the package get rebuilt, but with a different Cython version. If the Cython version that generated the shared module does not match the version that generated the module that tries to use it, it should fail on import with a clear error message that the whole package needs to be recompiled with a single Cython version.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of work, but seems relatively easy to do.

Also, though there are certainly some exceptions, Cython utility code tends towards those things that are either small enough to inline (vs. just calling the Python C API directly, or massaging parameters around a Python C API call) or specialized for the situation (e.g. the conversion operators). \r\n\r\nNote that the sharing of types is so that we can do things like instance (or even equality) checks across modules. \r\n\r\nI do think there may still be value in linking multiple modules into the same shared library, but the space savings do look fairly minimal.

            "body": "@da-woods, everyone, thanks for checking. I've also tried to repeat the analysis on one of my modules, and the outcome is directly the opposite: in my case the **\"shared part\" takes ~ 60% of the total module size**. My module do use memoryviews though. However, I believe memoryviews are so commonly used with Cython (ex scikit-learn), that their pesense should be assumed to be on by default. And that is _exactly_ one of the reasons to keep Cython utility code in a shared library.\r\n\r\nI might be wrong in my analysis somewhere, but I hope this observation demonstrates that solving this issue would have significant impact on code size, and also it would help to improve the speed of compilation (see also https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3646 on this).\r\n\r\nPlease find details of my analisys below.\r\n\r\nThanks beforehand,\r\nKirill\r\n\r\n---- 8< ----\r\n\r\nTest module: [mm.pyx](https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/wendelin.core/blob/36766e1d/wcfs/internal/mm.pyx)\r\nSize of compiled `mm.so` before strip: 445K\r\nSize of `mm.so` after strip: 240K\r\nEstimate for size of shared part: 140K\r\n\r\nThe estimate for shared part was built via:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ nm --print-size --radix=d mm.so | grep \"__[pP][yY][xX]\" |  grep --invert-match \"2mm\" | grep --invert-match \"__pyx_[kn]\" | grep --invert-match \"string_tab\" >x.txt\r\n\r\n$ awk '{s+=$2} END {print s}' <x.txt\r\n144069\r\n```\r\n\r\nTop-100 size users from shared part consititute 112K of the 140K total:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ sort --reverse -k2 x.txt  |head -100 |awk '{s+=$2} END {print s}'\r\n115506\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose top size users can be seen to be indeed mostly related to memoryview and arrays functionality:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ sort --reverse -k2 x.txt  |head

            "body": "After rereading the comments in this issue, I think what we should aim for is a binary package on PyPI that contains both the shared code in an extension module and the corresponding `.pxd` file with the interface declarations. Then, users can declare their code as depending on that, e.g. using `# cython: shared_code=True`, and Cython would look up the corresponding `.pxd` file with the version of the current Cython installation and use it to cimport the memoryview implementation (and whatever else there is to share).\r\n\r\nThis would require two packages to be installed by users who want to build their code with shared Cython internals: the `Cython` package for the compiler and a `Cython_shared` package, in the same version. Cython would not use its own shared code for the translation, but use the code provided by the `Cython_shared` package, and generate code to import that shared module at module init time.\r\n\r\nI think this is the easiest way for our users to manage the shared code.\r\n\r\nI also considered allowing `# cython: shared_code=3.1.0` to ask for a specific shared Cython version as target, but I think that would be difficult to support. Some parts of the shared implementation will always end up being included and/or inlined in the generated modules, which means that the Cython version would need to support different targets. I think it's reasonable to require the exact same versions for Cython and its shared code package to be installed.\r\n\r\nWe may allow a more specific configuration like `# cython: shared_code=memoryview`, i.e. giving users the choice which parts of the code they want to share. However, as it looks, we will start with sharing only the memoryview implementation to see where that gets us. And we can still add such a detailed option later if it turns out to make a difference. (If `shared_code=True` shares all code, then it's easy to add `shared_code=x,z` for sharing only some.)",

I think this is the easiest way for our users to manage the shared code.\r\n\r\nThat won't work I think, a couple of reasons that immediately come to mind:\r\n\r\n1. It's not possible for different projects to rely on different versions of `cython_shared` (you can have only 1 version installed in a single Python environment), and imposing the requirement that all packages on PyPI that want to use this must always be built with the same Cython version isn't workable.\r\n2. It requires declaring a new runtime dependency. That is pretty much a nonstarter for NumPy and SciPy at least. Aside from that, for any project: it would be a dynamic runtime dependency, only needed depending on how Cython is used (in shared mode or not). Dynamic dependencies are quite bad from a Python packaging perspective.\r\n\r\nIt'd be a lot easier to let the packages that want/need this functionality build `cython_shared` by themselves and include it in their own wheels. They anyway have a compiler at hand when they want to use Cython.  That keeps things self-contained. As long as there's a way to obtain the pxd file and the source code to build easily (something like `cython --generate-shared` followed by building an extension module from `cython_shared.c`?), I can't yet think of a problem with that approach. It meets the goal of sharing between all extensions within a single package, which is an easier goal than sharing between all extensions across all Cython-using packages.",

Cython 3.1.0 goes with a module called `cython_shared_310` or similar.\r\n\r\nBut seeing that written now makes me realise that this would probably pose issues either in PyPI (a new package for each release) or on user side (same package name, different module name, only one installable).

That's a sledge hammer approach, but would reduce the number of different package names that we drop on PyPI.

If the maintainers decide to use a shared package, they'd enable the Cython option and declare the dependency in their wheel build, and that's it. That's not dynamic at all. Other packages that don't use code sharing can happily live together with those that do.",

It means that all cython_shared 3.1.X are backward compatible and if we will introduce incompatible change, we will do it only for minor release like 3.2.0 or even major release like 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nBut I think we are not quite there. I propose to start small don't publish shared utility code to PyPI. Let's start with only possibility to generate and use shared utility code in package. Later, we can start possibility to publish it also to PyPI. I think even after some users will prefer to use \"local\" utility extention instead of PyPI.",

There's also the issue of users building from source, and they are likely to have a different Cython version installed - that will not work well at all, so it'd require an exact pin like `cython==3.1.2` (no more bug fixes that can be picked up ....) and then praying that people don't get it wrong too often without build isolation. To get that not exact-pinned and reliably correct, you do actually need to generated the dependency metadata dynamically at build time based on the Cython version that is detected.\r\n\r\n> Oh, people will drown us in their hate if we ever do anything wrong in a new release. :) \r\n\r\nYeah that too:) Having broken the NumPy ABI twice in the last 15 years (pretty decent stability track record), I can confirm that mistakes in that area generate a flood of issues/unhappiness.\r\n\r\n> But seeing that written now makes me realise that this would probably pose issues either in PyPI\r\n\r\nThis is the biggest problem though - I don't think your sledge hammer approach will be very pleasant for either yourself or for downstream maintainers.",
