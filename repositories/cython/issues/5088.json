Disabling the new behaviour does not degrade existing code bases in any way, it just keeps them as buggy as they are.\r\n\r\nThis new option does not reduce the burden for the migration, though. In order to migrate even just one single function, users will have to remove the option again, and then adapt the entire module, as well as potentially starting with other modules that call into the one at hand. So, the risk is high that users just add the option and leave it there, lacking the time to migrate.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we could continue to issue the warnings if the option is provided. In any case, the option would probably have to be separate from the `noexcept` function modifier, so this should de detectable.\r\n\r\nSo, it feels difficult to actually help users with the migration by providing some kind of intermediate steps. It seems the migration is either all or nothing. And this option keeps it at nothing. I understand the need, but it would be great to have something that actually helps migrating instead.",
