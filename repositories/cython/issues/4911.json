Since Python 2 was already deprecated a few years ago, no sane distro shipped a gdb build with `--with-python=python2`. That is why I put that in the Documentation, because you *had* to build your own gdb. *Now*, cygdb works  with  a gdb that is build with `--with-python=python3` , i.e. a normal gdb that you got from your distro. \r\n\r\nI will fix the documentation right after I fixed `cygdb exec`.",
