That's probably unlikely to change soon (adding even `int` template parameters have turned out to be difficult, but improvements are obviously welcome)\r\n\r\nIf you're just passing pointers to `cdef` functions you could try telling Cython that it's a C-style function pointer (and let C++ handle the conversion). Or you could use `void my_function[T](vector[T] &arg1, ...)` to tell it that the function accepts basically any argument type (again, relying on C++ to work out what's happening).\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cython-users is the better place to try to find a suitable workaround.",
