I am getting __Pyx_RaiseUnboundLocalError decorations around variable within a loop that cannot be unbound, since the structure is like\r\n\r\n```\r\nif cond:\r\n  a = <bind>\r\nelse:\r\n  b = <bind>\r\nc = <bind>\r\nfor i in range(100):\r\n  common_function(c)\r\n  if cond:\r\n      special_a(a)\r\n  else:\r\n     special_b(b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan I disable these checks?  Or do I need separate paths where all variables are clearly bound?",
