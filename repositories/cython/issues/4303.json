Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCython dataclasses should follow the lead of regular dataclasses and generate the `__match_args__` special attribute to help them work with 3.10 structural pattern matching.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis isn't in my initial PR for supporting dataclasses because it wasn't a feature when I first wrote the PR (i.e. I didn't forget it... it appeared since then). It doesn't require Cython to support structural pattern matching itself (because just having the attribute can help them work with Python). However, I don't want to add them to the initial PR because it's big enough as-is, and it's not a feature I understand well-enough yet to be able to test.\r\n\r\nTherefore just creating an issue to note that it's a missing feature for now.",
