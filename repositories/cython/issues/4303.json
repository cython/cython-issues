Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCython dataclasses were implemented based on Python dataclasses from [PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/). Since then Python has added a extra features to their dataclasses module:\r\n\r\n- [ ] the `__match_args__` special attribute to help them work with 3.10 structural pattern matching. Implementing this doesn't actually require Cython to support structural pattern matching itself (because just having the method means they can work with Python code). - branch https://github.com/da-woods/cython/tree/dataclasses_match_args (no PR yet)\r\n- [x] `kw_only` - which allows keyword only arguments to the constructor - https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/d9709b249f4a1dd73946f5077866a1b81ba0b128\r\n- [ ] (related) the `KW_ONLY` sentinel value to identify further arguments as keyword only\r\n- [ ] (related) `kw_only` as an argument for `field`\r\n- [ ] `slots` - I don't think this is worth implementing because it's basically true by default for Cython. But maybe we should be aware of the option so that it doesn't generate an error?\r\n\r\nCython should support these features.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm adding \"help wanted\" now that the initial version of cdef dataclasses are merged. @da-woods probably doesn't have time to do this is the immediate future (but probably will in the long-term if no-one else implements it first). Therefore, if you have a need for these features then feel free to make a start!",
