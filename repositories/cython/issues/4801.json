    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nFor the operators `+=`/`-=`/`*=`/`/=`/`%=`/`^=`/`&=`/`|=` invalid code is generated when using them on pointers to `structs`/`classes`. Currently the following code:\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython.operator cimport dereference\r\n\r\nctypedef struct Test:\r\n    int a\r\n\r\ndef test():\r\n    cdef Test* b = NULL\r\n    dereference(b).a += 1\r\n```\r\ngenerates the following C/C++ code:\r\n```c\r\n__pyx_t_4test_Test __pyx_t_1;\r\n__pyx_t_1 = (*__pyx_v_b);\r\n__pyx_t_1.a = (__pyx_t_1.a + 1);\r\n```\r\nthis means the assignment is only performed on the temporary and therefor has no effect.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThere are a couple of ways to improve this:\r\n1) these operators are already forbidden for direct usage with dereference:\r\n```cython\r\ndef test():\r\n    cdef int* a = NULL;\r\n    dereference(a) += 1;\r\n```\r\ncurrently leads to the following error `Illegal operand for inplace operation.`. It would be certainly better to prevent the usage than generating broken code.\r\n2) I do not see any reason why this temporary even has to be generated here, so the code gen e.g. for `+=` could be\r\n```c\r\n(*__pyx_v_b).a = ((*__pyx_v_b) + 1);\r\n```\r\n3) the code gen from 2) is strictly speaking still not correct in C++, since the operators `+` and `+=` can have different behaviors. Even though this is rare, this means it would be best to avoid the transformation from `+=` to `+`:\r\n```c\r\n(*__pyx_v_b).a += 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: any\r\n - Python version any\r\n - Cython version: 3.0.0a10",
