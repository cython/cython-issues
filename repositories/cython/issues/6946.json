The reason why it's often used is that pep 484 recommends that  \"checked functions have annotations for all arguments and the return type\". I want to use it simply for documentation purposes, at least for now.\n\nIf backward compatibility wasn't an issue, I'd probably propose that the C implementation of the function return a C int with -1 for an exception like much of the Python C api. But backward compatibility is probably an issue and just have the function return an object is almost as good. \n\nI'm one who has been burned by exception swallowing a number of times and reflexively writes exception specs when returning a C number or bint. My intuition is that the performance ordering of return conventions from fastest to slowest is (1) returning a C int and checking, (2) returning PyObject*, and (3) using C void as return type and calling PyErr_Occurred(). But I also know that intuition about performance can be wrong.",

Moreover, philosophy of Cython is \"you get what you write\" hence we should not function with `-> None` optimise to return value as C integer etc...\n\nBut I do support allowing `-> None` in cdef/cpdef functions.",

Still, defaulting None to object seems acceptable to me and is easier to implement than special casing this to return an error code or use void. I'll plan to create a PR that does this in the next few days. I'll also check to see if def f(n: None): works if f is a cdef / cpdef, even though I find it hard to come up with a reason to use it in actual code.",
