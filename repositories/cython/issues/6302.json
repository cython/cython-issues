We could do even more.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n- [ ] Generate optimised code also for `bytearray`.\r\n- [ ] Unpack literal start/tail tuples into separate comparison calls (maybe unless we're in global module code).\r\n- [ ] Adapt to the type of the start/tail argument, which is often constant and usually has the same type as the searched string, so we could have e.g. a \"bytes in bytes\" variant that ends up short enough to be inlined.\r\n\r\nAll of these together could lead to very tight comparison code for common cases like \"bytes in bytes\" and \"homogenous tuple of bytes in bytes\".\r\n\r\nThe effect is somewhat similar to the `FlattenInListTransform`, which unpacks `x in [...]` into separate comparisons in order to optimise them separately.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
