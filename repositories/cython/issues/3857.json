If I condense my `pyx` file that is in my project down to the same contents as `x.pyx` and run `python setup.py build_ext -i`, I get the compilation error. I tried without any compiler directives set, and got the same error. Although the code I am working on right now is will be open-sourced, it is currently not. If you think it would be valuable to see the project in it's entirety, I would be more than willing to reach out to the proper channels to get you a tar file of it.",
