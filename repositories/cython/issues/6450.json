They currently aren't.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts:\r\n* `global2` almost definitely should be - it's almost always wrong to try to share objects between interpreters.\r\n* I think it'd be good to have consistency between object and non-object globals. Which implies that they both should be on the module state.\r\n* `cdef extern` globals wouldn't be on the module state though.\r\n* It would be good to let the user choose (if we can find a good syntax), although we'd still need to pick a default.\r\n\r\nIf we did put them on the module state the main consequence is that it'd become difficult (probably impossible) to access them without the GIL because we wouldn't have a way of acquiring the correct module state. This would be a significant limitation. (In this case I'd propose to turn `CYTHON_USE_MODULE_STATE` off in limited API builds, since I don't see why a generic limited API build should have to suffer that limitation).",
