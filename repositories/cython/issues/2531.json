Essentially this dance:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html#distributing-cython-modules\r\n\r\n[PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) and [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) provide ways to configure certain build system tools for a given project. This can be used to provide a simple Cython build package that does this once and for all, is distributed separately via PyPI, and internally calls Cython when necessary and requested, but otherwise just replaces the `.pyx` files by pre-generated `.c` files that come with the source distribution.\r\n\r\nIt would become a dependency of Cython itself and some parts of the `cythonize()` implementation would be moved into the new build package. Meaning, most of the code is already there in one way or another, just needs to be extracted and cleanly put into an external package.\r\n\r\nAlso see #1981, which could be solved at the same time (in a single package).",

This would allow for the setup.py to remain clear of any Cython specific parameters. The build system would only need to be more capable when the user wishes to explicitly run `cythonize` on their code.\r\n\r\nThis additional functionality would ideally be built into setuptools, for example using the setuptools_scm approach. This allows Cython to be detected and only allow `cythonize` to be invoked (perhaps through --cythonize flag to build_ext) if the Cython module exists (I believe the old cython integration into setuptools did something like this). There can also be a new argument for `setup()` which could represent `cythonize_args: {**kwargs}`. \r\n\r\nThe more difficult part about this approach is the fact that for a Cython extension to be built by distutils/setuptools without invoking cythonize, all sources must be specified as their generated filename and not their pyx one which is a shift in mindset and also potentially a non-trivial implementation which applies the reverse transition of .cpp/.c -> .pyx through source file discovery, alternatively this could be done in cythonize itself.",

Only if the user runs it in some sort of \"--cythonize\" mode, should we attempt to invoke cythonize. However for this all that is needed imo is to discover the presence of Cython artefacts (by scanning the source repository as highlighted above) and substituting them instead of the generated files. After this we still invoke cythonize which would do all the more complex generation steps that would use this meta-data at that point, and cythonize would affectively reverse the substitution following its generation logic.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm missing something but I'm not sure what distutils needs from the Cython meta-data during the build process presuming it is NOT running the \"cythonize\" path, but just compiling C/C++ sources?\r\n\r\n@jdemeyer\r\nSpeaking from my perspective only, the benefits of not depending on Cython are:\r\n- You separate the cython step from the build step, if you have non trivial cythonize scenario (e.g. shared .pxd assets which are not distributed with your source repo). In my organisation it would make sense to distribute .pxd with our C++ libraries over an internal DPKG distribution and when it comes to shipping to PyPI we would rather not expose this complex process.\r\n- If we manage to add this support into say setuptools then no extra build dependencies would be required",

It is an important design goal of Cython to make the emitted C code \"generate once!\" and simple to use in as many environments as possible. Building C-implemented extensions is something that Python has built-in. Everything beyond that should be imposed on Cython users but not on their end-users.",

He has provided a simple example implementation here, which isn't complete (lacks JSON support), but gives the idea:\r\nhttps://github.com/eyakimov-bbg/python-testmodule/blob/cython_build_ext/setup.py\r\n\r\nHere's a spelled out proposal:\r\n\r\n1) We implement this in setuptools.\r\n\r\n2) Users should create `Extension` instances again, but list the generated `.c` / `.cpp` files in their list of sources. This is backwards compatible with the current Cython support in setuptools, which is only triggered by `.pyx` files.\r\n\r\n3) By default, setuptools will run over the list of extensions, and check every source file with a `.c*` file extension for the start bytes `b\"/* Generated by Cython \"`.\r\n3a) If the marker is found, it will read the JSON meta-data in the section between `/* BEGIN: Cython Metadata` and `END: Cython Metadata */` and add all `distutils` related options to the `Extension`. This is a straight forward thing to do, because the information is right there, named as distutils wants it, including all file dependencies that Cython found.\r\n3b) It is an error if an extension source file does not exist. setuptools could help here by giving a nice error message if it finds a file with the same name but `.pyx` as extension.\r\n\r\n4) We add a new `--rebuild-with-cython` option (or `--cythonize`, as Evgeny suggested) to setuptools that, when passed to `setup.py`, does the following.\r\n4a) (maybe) If Cython is not installed, the latest version will be pip-installed. Optionally, `--rebuild-with-cython` could accept a version as argument, i.e. `--rebuild-with-cython=0.28.5`. This could be passed from a Makefile etc., so that end-users of a source checkout don't have to care about it.\r\n4b) With this option, `setuptools` will change its behaviour, and for every `.c*` source file of an extension (that has the `Generated by Cython` marker?) check for a corresponding `.pyx` file immediately. If it exists, it will collect this `Extension` in a list of Cython extension modules, replace the source file name with the `.pyx` file, and in the end, call `cythonize()` on the list of Cython extension modules that it found.\r\n\r\nI like this proposal, because it keeps all Cython specific functionality in Cython's `cythonize()`, while allowing Cython sdists to build in a straight forward way in `setuptools` without Cython as a dependency. Only source checkouts require a special option, which I find acceptable.",
