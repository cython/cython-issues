Is this a bug or am I misinterpreting the docs? \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nOS: Windows\r\nPython version 3.10.2\r\nCython version 3.0.0a11",

If you do any arithmetic on the variable afterwards, you'd probably end up with a C double value instead of a C float value at some point, unless you're very careful typing literals as C float instead of C double.\r\n\r\nIn any case, inferring the `attr` variable as Python float object in your example seems wrong.
