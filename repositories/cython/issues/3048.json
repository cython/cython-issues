    "body": "I've got a python-space class that is a thin wrapper around a np.ndarray, and I'd like to make this into a buffer-protocol-compliant cython class so I can pass it to memoryview-expecting cython functions without having to unwrap it every time.\r\n\r\nMy intuition was that this would look like\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef Wrapper:\r\n    cdef readonly:\r\n        ndarray _orig\r\n\r\n    def __cinit__(self, ndarray orig, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        self._orig = orig\r\n\r\n    def __getbuffer__(self, Py_buffer *view, int flags):\r\n        self._orig.__getbuffer__(view, flags)\r\n\r\n     def __releasebuffer__(self, Py_buffer *view):\r\n         self._orig.__releasebuffer__(view)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I do this, I get a compile-time error pointing to `self._orig.__releasebuffer__` reading `Cannot convert Py_buffer * to Python object` which suggests to me that `__releasebuffer__` is not in the ndarray c-namespace.\r\n\r\nSo the request is for a recipe or docs on how to create one memoryview-class that just wraps another.",
