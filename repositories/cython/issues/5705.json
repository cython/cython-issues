Please describe.\n\nWhen using @cython.overflowcheck with tools like UBSAN you end up with failures because the arithmetic still is performed, giving you undefined results until the OverflowError gets raised\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nAs far as I can tell Cython generates this code for multiplication overflow checking:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic CYTHON_INLINE int __Pyx_mul_const_int_checking_overflow(int a, int b, int *overflow) {\r\n    if (b > 1) {\r\n        *overflow |= a > __PYX_MAX(int) / b;\r\n        *overflow |= a < __PYX_MIN(int) / b;\r\n    } else if (b == -1) {\r\n        *overflow |= a == __PYX_MIN(int);\r\n    } else if (b < -1) {\r\n        *overflow |= a > __PYX_MIN(int) / b;\r\n        *overflow |= a < __PYX_MAX(int) / b;\r\n    }\r\n    return a * b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the results of the multiplication are undefined I am guessing we could return almost anything here? Alternately we could give users a `@cython.overflowcheck.return_value()` decorator that specifies what value they would like back in such instances, or maybe even a new `@cython.overflowcheck.fail_fast()` decorator where the user can still choose to continue with the multiplication or not\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nWhen using UBSAN you could also work with a suppression file, but I think that is harder for users to set up and properly maintain\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
