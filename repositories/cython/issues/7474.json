Please describe.\n\nAs noted in https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7447#issuecomment-3766371063, I think there might be some value including strings into fast path of comparisons.\n\nMore and more often I find myself working with type-agnostic algorithms that involve element comparisons.\nAlthough they need to be type-agnostic, naturally `str` remains a common type.\n\nExample that pin-points performance benefit:\n```cython\ndef search(element, iterable):\n    i: cython.Py_ssize_t = 0\n    el1: object | str = element\n    el2: object | str\n    for el2 in iterable:\n        if el2 == el1:\n            return i\n        i += 1\n```\nTimings:\n```python\n%timeit search('a', '_' * 100_000 + 'a')\n# 5.3 ms (pure python)\n# 1.6 ms (cython with `object`)\n# 0.4 ms (cython with `str`)\n```\n\nOf course, this shows maximum benefit.\nFor real applications, it is rare that comparisons comprise such large portion of computation.\nTimings for KMP with the same setup as above:\n```python\ns1 = '_' * 10 + 'a'\ns2 = '_' * 100_000 + 'a'\n%timeit KMPattern(s1).search(s2)\n# 17 ms (pure python)\n# 4.3 ms (cython with `object`)\n# 2.2 ms (cython with `str`)\n```\n\nSo even for more involved algorithms, the performance benefit can be non-trivial.\n\n---\n\nSo I think `str` application might be useful.\n\nI don't know about `bytes` / `bytearray` - these so far have been rarer in my applications.\nMainly due to the fact that a large portion of cases are single character, thus elements most often become `int`.\n\nHowever, I suspect that:\n1. These could be useful - after all most of string algorithms in `sdlib` can handle all: `str`, `bytes` and `bytearray`\n2. The logic to do this is likely very similar as for `str`\n\n---\n\nSo in short, if overhead for non-applicable cases is negligible (I think you have a good idea on this from https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7447) then maybe this is worth consideration.\n",
