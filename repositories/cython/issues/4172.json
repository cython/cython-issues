Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nIt's possible to get an infinite loop for an add (and presumably other operators) operator that returns `NotImplemented` when used with a derived class.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class Base:\r\n    def __add__(self, other):\r\n        return NotImplemented\r\n\r\nclass Derived(Base):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\nand to test:\r\n```\r\n>>> import hmmm\r\n>>> x = hmmm.Base()\r\n>>> y = hmmm.Derived()\r\n>>> y+x   # works OK as expected\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Derived' and 'hmmm.Base'\r\n>>> x+y\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `x+y` I get an infinite loop but [Pandas reports segmentation fault](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/34213#issuecomment-842694795) - probably just to do with tail-call recursion optimization or not.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nShould just be `NotImplementedError`\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Python version 3.8.9\r\n - Cython version 0e80efb82480b777057770ce2006a6b46ec46028 (close to current master)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI think this is to do with the changes to support `__radd__` etc.. I think it's somewhere in:\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/034fc26c1c25b5b69581464b73136038bb201ce4/Cython/Utility/ExtensionTypes.c#L383\r\nHowever, I haven't traced the error through in great detail so not 100% sure exactly what's gone wrong.\r\n",

You can get it not to crash by using `specific_known_type->tp_base` rather than `Py_TYPE(left_or_right)->tp_base`, which is an improvement but doesn't quite bring it in line with Python behaviour. I suspect we'll have to compromise a bit on how closely we can hit Python behaviour though.",

I can create a PR for that if needed. It's basically https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/b66b0ac0bca62dfa1a67237900a56012c8164395, but with the tests tweaked a little. I was going to suggest that as a short-term fix for the next release, but I think I missed the window to do that.\r\n\r\nI think in the longer-term calling inherited `nb_add` (etc.) slots is doomed to failure. I think the best option is to call the specific `__add__`/`__radd__` functions. This can be resolved at compile-time in a lot of cases, but in the general case it'll require the `__add__`/`__radd__` functions to also be available via the class dict.",
