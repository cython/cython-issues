    "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nFirst of all, I use Cython for a very large-scale project. Because the project was built over time, initially I was writing lot of functions like \r\n```\r\ncdef int foo() nogil except -1:\r\n    return something_can_be_minus_1\r\n```\r\n...to propagate exceptions in case function `foo` returns -1.\r\n\r\nHowever, if this `foo` function is wrapped in some other functions, like this:\r\n```\r\ncpdef void bar() except *:\r\n    foo()\r\n    print('here')\r\n```\r\nThe behavior seems undefined (?), as no exception will be raised. The program will silently stop at line `foo()` (i.e. won't print anything, and more importantly, the program won't fail either). \r\n\r\nThis makes debugging hard and very confusing, especially for people who haven't used Cython for long. \r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI wonder if we could disable this syntax, or make it fail in case `foo` returns -1, or anything that makes it clear instead of a gray area. \n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

If `-1` is also a valid return value then use `except? -1`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncpdef void bar() except *:\r\n    foo()\r\n    print('here')\r\n```\r\n\r\nCython will internally check the return value of `foo` and propagate the exception if it's `-1`. Thus the code will work as intended.\r\n\r\nFeel free to suggest improvements to the documentation if you don't feel it explains it well enough.\r\n\r\n",
