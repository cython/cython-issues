    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nSince Cython 3.0, when installing a package into a virtualenv with `pip install -e --config-settings editable_mode=strict ...`, the shared object files of the package's Cython extensions are not included in the \"symlink tree\" generated by the `editable_wheel` setuptools command and thus cannot be imported.\r\n\r\nThe regression is probably caused by the switch to the `distutils` variant of the `build_ext` class as the base class of `Cython.Distutils.build_ext.build_ext` (before 3.0, the `setuptools` variant was used for `new_build_ext` ). The `distutils` variant of `build_ext` does not provide the `get_output_mapping` method, which is used by `editable_wheel` to build the symlink tree.\r\n\r\nThe `editable_mode=strict` installation worked as expected with Cython 0.29 when using the `new_build_ext` class.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n1. Create package containing Cython extensions\r\n2. Use ` cmdclass={\"build_ext\": Cython.Distutils.build_ext.build_ext} ` in `setup.py`\r\n3. Install package into virtualenv using `pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=strict`\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nCython extensions should be importable.\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\nTested 3.7, 3.11\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.0\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Thanks to the convoluted maze of conditional imports both in Setuptools' and Cython's `build_ext`, the regular (Setuptools) `build_ext` class winds up deriving from the Cython one and does all the right things. So the solution is to simply drop the `cmdclass` option.",
