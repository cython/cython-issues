My question is:\r\n\r\na new output array will be created during every call of rfftn and irfftn？ If this is true, I need to switch to FFTW object and keep the output array by myself to prevent the cost of create new array.\r\n\r\nor the output array is kept by cython during the life time of the calculation？ \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help!
