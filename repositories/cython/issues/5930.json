When I compile my .py code ( which includes admin.py) I get the following error: \r\n\r\nsave_model() takes exactly 5 positional arguments (3 given)\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n# example code\r\n```\r\nsimply compile your Django project with Django-mass-edit installed.  Attempt to make a mass edit in the admin portion of the application and press save. The error appears after you press save.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nexpect Django-mass-edit to work as it does when not compiled.\n\n### OS\n\nlinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.10.12\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.2\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

You can start the dev server using \"python manage.py runserver 0:8000\" from the pixel directory.\r\n\r\nFurther testing shows that the issue arrises when I create a custom save for my model.  It does not occur if I don't have a custom save mode.

Also, the fact that it says \"3 arguments given\" instead of 5 seems odd. If anything goes wrong with a method, it's usually off by one due to `self`, not off by two.
