Essentially it keeps reading indefinitely until it finds the next `}` which may be well outside the raw string.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\nraw_literal_with_named_escape = r\"\\N{this is fine because\"\nsomething_else = '}'\n```\n\nGives\nUnexpected token None:'' in string literal\"\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nIt should behave as Python does\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13\n\n### Cython version\n\nCurrent master (but probably every version back to 0.0.1)\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have a fix for this which'll appear shortly",
