It hits this error:\r\n> `unable to validate whether bases have a __dict__ when CYTHON_USE_TYPE_SLOTS is off (likely because you are building in the limited API). Therefore, all extension types with multiple bases must add 'cdef dict __dict__' in this compilation mode`\r\n\r\nfrom [here](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/ce1aa59ab6300e18e50c752b5c9e28a04b665060/Cython/Utility/ExtensionTypes.c#L158). Am I correct that the failure is expected, and so the test should expect to hit that message when testing this configuration?",

That definitely means you can't do it in the limited API.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether we should make the guard\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if !CYTHON_USE_TYPE_SLOTS && CYTHON_COMPILING_IN_LIMITED_API\r\n```\r\n\r\nand just cheat and access `tp_dictoffset` directly otherwise.... (i.e. treat the macro as \"avoid type slots wherever possible\").\r\n\r\nBut yes - this seems like we'd currently expect it to fail. This is possibly somewhere where we could update or skip the test as well (we'll probably have to do this when we get as far as running the test in the limited api).",
