    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nWe have seen this in scikit-learn CI this morning (east European time) where we have a daily CI that runs against the development version of our dependencies including Cython, see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/32022.\n\nA git bisect points to c18627cf0c6b933248addc2225ea602d1f58e945, which seems to make sense since the error is about fused types:\n```\nerror: redefinition of ‘__pyx_ff_map_fused_2_000_double__and_float’\n```\n\nIt could also well be that we are doing some weird things in scikit-learn ...\n\nLooking at the Cython nightly wheel upload ([12 hours ago](https://github.com/cython/cython/actions/runs/17255420129/job/48966141522) and [4 days ago](https://github.com/cython/cython/actions/runs/17182971590/job/48747924851)) it looks like this happens in between these 2 commits:\n```\ngit l af509320cf8f8585d589c757e3bb5ac31006e287...f906608b24b3757897b81fa7feb28be50bf255a8\n* f906608b2 - Fix Limited API in api.h files (#7110) (18 hours ago) <da-woods>\n* d9ca7d0f2 - Remove timeout and warning from py_thread_type_lock (#7081) (18 hours ago) <da-woods>\n* c30852923 - Fix a crash in sys.monitoring (#7063) (18 hours ago) <da-woods>\n* ebdfec8c9 - Remove unused scanners code (GH-7049) (19 hours ago) <da-woods>\n* fbe126af4 - Fix typo in changelog. (20 hours ago) <Stefan Behnel>\n* 2a1993586 - Update changelog. (25 hours ago) <Stefan Behnel>\n* 7672ec0b2 - Library: Add declarations for new refcounting C-API functions in Py3.14. (25 hours ago) <Stefan Behnel>\n* c18627cf0 - Reduce redundancy in fused type dispatch functions (GH-7100) (2 days ago) <scoder>\n* 3f1dcfba3 - Enable one more fstring error test (#7105) (3 days ago) <da-woods>\n* c600196f5 - Remove a breakpoint() call that shouldn't be there (#7104) (3 days ago) <da-woods>\n```\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn --depth 1\ncd scikit-learn\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install meson-python ninja scipy git+https://github.com/cython/cython\npip install . --no-build-isolation -v\n# you can also do this to only build one of the problematic file (change name of the file to match Python and OS)\n# meson setup build --reconfigure\n# ninja -C build sklearn/_loss/_loss.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.p/meson-generated__loss.c.o\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNo error\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13\n\n### Cython version\n\nDevelopment version\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe source file is actually a [templated file](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/_loss/_loss.pyx.tp) that we use to generate the code with tempita IIRC, so it could well be that scikit-learn is doing some not really supported things",
