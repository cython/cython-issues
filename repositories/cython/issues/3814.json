Based on whether the argument to `foo` is an lvalue or rvalue, it should dispatch to the appropriate overload of `f`. Thus, the expected output of this program is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRvalue\r\nLvalue\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe C++ code generated by Cython for the above currently looks like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n  __pyx_v_10forwarding_x = 1;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n  foo<long>(1);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\n  foo<int>(__pyx_v_10forwarding_x);       // this line is incorrect currently\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `foo` accepts a forwarding reference, the template argument should be of the form:\r\n\r\n* `int&` if the corresponding function argument is an lvalue expression\r\n* `int` if the corresponding function argument is an rvalue expression\r\n\r\nOne solution is to let [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) handle producing the correct template argument. In this case, the  C++ code would look like this::\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nfoo<decltype((1))>(1);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\nfoo<decltype((__pyx_v_10forwarding_x))>(__pyx_v_10forwarding_x);      \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other solution is for Cython to compute the appropriate template argument _a priori_. In this case, the C++ code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nfoo<long>(1);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\nfoo<int&>(__pyx_v_10forwarding_x);  \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich of these sounds better from a Cython viewpoint?\r\n\r\ncc: @da-woods if you have any suggestions here.

In general though, it seems like Cython wants to explicitly instantiate templates with template arguments rather than taking advantage of C++ template deduction. Is there a reason for this?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I believe it's not possible to use template deduction _just_ for forwarding references:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ntemplate <typename T, typename U>\r\nvoid foo(T&& first, U second) { };\r\n\r\nfoo(a, b) # OK\r\nfoo<int&, int>(a, b) # OK\r\nfoo<int>(a, b) # not OK\r\n```",

Is there a reason for this?\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure. My guesses would be: 1) sometimes you do need to specify the template types (e.g. for a return type, but then also for any types that appear before the return type) so it's easier to do just do it consistently. 2) Cython usually needs to make sure that the types are what it thinks they are (e.g. for generating `somevar = function_call(args)` it needs to ensure that `somevar` is of the right type) and therefore likes to control what calls are made.",
