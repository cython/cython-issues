I'll be playing with it from here on out.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately though, the way it is currently implemented is not ideal due to the missing features of Cython. Here they are from the most to least wanted:\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Stack tuples](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3985)\r\n- [ ] [Typed arrays](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3995)\r\n- [ ] [Stack discriminated unions](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3990)\r\n\r\nThe reason why I cannot do these personally is because they would require getting involved with memory management. I'd rather such considerations be a part of the target platform itself. Ultimately, that is a part of why I am compiling to high level languages with developed ecosystems like Cython and F#. I know that reference counting is a complicated subject, and do not want to get caught up inadvertently doing research on that. I have many other things I want to do instead.\r\n\r\nThe way the Cython backend is currently, it will still be blazing fast compared to regular Python, but not at its full capacity. It is worth noting that the F# backend has all of these desired features at the moment. \r\n\r\nThey aren't really deal breakers. F# for example did not have stack tuples nor stack unions for the longest time and it has been a great language, but I won't feel the Cython backend is complete until these features have landed. After all, Spiral does focus on performance as much as expressiveness.",
