But although I am using this Flag with False, my error messages still show the original python stack traces so I guess my code is not obfuscated right?\r\n\r\nHow to achieve that?",

Obfuscation is a use-case we don't really care about. Any obfuscation you may get is largely accidental. Cython is open source so you're welcome to use it for whatever you like of course.\r\n3. Stack traces are generated by reading from the source file. If the source file isn't present then they'll give less information (but not no information)",
