    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen I use the Cython coverage plugin, it does not work for signatures of inline functions defined in a pxd file. This does not apply to inline functions defined in a pyx file. Since inline functions tend to be rather short, it often looks like the test coverage of my pxd files is really bad (50-60%), although in reality, 100% of the lines are covered.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nTest and trace an inline function that is defined in a pxd file. The function body will be marked green (covered), whereas the signature line will be marked red (uncovered).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf at least one line of the body is covered, the signature line should be marked as covered as well.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: any\r\n - Python version: 3.9.5\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.24\r\n",
