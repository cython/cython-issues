To illustrate please see the code below:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncpdef func():\r\n    cdef const char* p = b\"\"\r\n    cdef const char[::1] mv = <const char[:0:1]>p\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis compiles without issues. However at runtime we get the following exception:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n<some SO file> in View.MemoryView.array.__cinit__()\r\n\r\nValueError: Invalid shape in axis 0: 0.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough if we assigned an empty `bytes` object to a memory view (also length `0`), this problem would not arise.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncpdef func():\r\n    cdef const unsigned char[::1] mv = b\"\"\r\n```",
