Since it's not trivial to implement that, I propose another way to workaround:\r\n\r\n```\r\nctypedef struct ohmygod:\r\n      int common\r\n\r\nIF UNAME_SYSNAME == \"Windows\":\r\n      ctypedef struct ohmygod:\r\n            int greece\r\nELSE:\r\n      ctypedef struct ohmygod:\r\n            float pelvis\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is to allow partial definition in Cython (this feature is like [\"partial\" keyword in C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods)). I have tried this idea, Cython won't report error but simply ignore the second definition. Is this way easier to implement in Cython?",

And I would not want this as a feature, because it makes it hard to understand for users what the actual definition of the struct is. It should be defined in one place, not split across multiple definitions, each of which is incomplete (and wrong) by itself.",
