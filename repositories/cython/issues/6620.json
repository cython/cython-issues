We should possibly test this.\n\nI've never used web-assembly personally so don't really know where to start even running it in browser. And I definitely don't know how you'd run it on a CI. But if anyone did know and had an interest in setting it up then I think it'd be worthwhile to test at least one Python version with it.",

Am I right in thinking that this would have to change?\n\nThe extension runs in the browser and also in JS/WASM runtimes like Node.js, and https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build provides a `pyodide venv` command that will set up a Pyodide virtual environment for you with a Python interpreter, where the platform name is \"emscripten\". While it offers a Pythonic interface, it is really a polyglot binary that runs Pyodide's cross-compiled rendition of CPython in Node.js. It is possible to install most packages, such as `pytest` and the like in it how you would install them in a more conventional Python virtual environment. However, spawning a subprocess with this interpreter would not work, however, as things are cross-compiled, you can run `pyodide build` to package the extension module(s) and load them in a WASM environment separately. I haven't looked into how Cython's test suite is organised or structured, but yes, you are right – it might need to change ever so slightly.",

It is used when you want to cross-compile packages, as it provides the Pyodide runtime and necessary patched `sysconfig` data to do so. The Pyodide virtual environment (`pyodide venv`) offers a WASM Python interpreter similar to other virtual environments, which does not need the xbuildenv.\n\n> Do you have an example of a project that has a `pytest` test case suite that one can run in both native and in emscripten ? It's been a while since I had a look at the `pyodide` docs, maybe I'll find it there ... ?\n\nYes, many Scientific Python packages have a `pytest`-based test suite that you can run in both natively and in Emscripten. NumPy, statsmodels, pandas, and many others, etc. would be some notable examples.\n\nFor instance, [statsmodels/statsmodels@`8600926`/statsmodels/tools/_test_runner.py](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/8600926f2f22e58779a667d82047a90318b20431/statsmodels/tools/_test_runner.py) runs `pytest.main()` with a bunch of user-defined arguments passed to it. However, a `subprocess`-based test runner would not work, of course.\n\nI think it makes sense to expand more on this in the Pyodide docs on testing packages out-of-tree, a bit more than what we currently have.\n",
