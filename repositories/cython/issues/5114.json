When I try to compile this I get a syntax error saying `Expected ')', found '='`\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n# example code\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\nORANGE = \"\\u001b[38;5;209;1m\"  # orange color in the terminal, this was that \"constant_in_module_scope\" from before\r\n\r\ndef test_function():\r\n    print(ORANGE, end='')\r\n    # from here I would actually print other stuff that I wanted in orange\r\n    # ...\r\n    # print RESET code here, with the same `end=''` kwarg\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nto compile without a syntax error\n\n### Environment\n\nOS: Arch Linux\r\nPython version: 3.11.0 (installed via AUR)\r\nCython version: 0.29.32 (installed in a venv)\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n- I am using pure-python mode\r\n- the file in question doesn't contain any cython decorators (I was just seeing if it would compile a change I made in another file first)",
