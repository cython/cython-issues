In this case we're prioritizing code-size over speed by not manually unrolling the loop to `PyTuple_New(...); PyTuple_SetItem(0, item0); PyTuple_SetItem(1, item1)`.\n\nIt's been claimed (but I can't find the exact numbers right now) that C varargs don't have the best performance and passing arrays around is a little quicker. Python 3.15 adds `PyTuple_FromArray` for this reason but we already have our own versions.\n\nMy second reason for wanting to do this that MSVC+ARM has a compiler bug where it passes the wrong arguments for sufficiently large varargs functions. Obviously MSVC should fix that and we shouldn't have to work around it. But the workaround is probably an improvement anyway.\n\nChange is:\n\n```\nsome_temp = PyTuple_Pack(3, temp0, temp1, temp2);\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n{\n    PyObject *temp_args[] = {temp0, temp1, temp2};\n    some_temp = PyTuple_FromArray(temp_args, 3);\n}\n```",
