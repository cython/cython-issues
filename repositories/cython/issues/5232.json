Run tests: `python test_cython/runtests.py` (which fails with \"'gmpy2.pxd' not found\", etc)\r\n6. Now do usual install: `pip install .`\r\n7. Run tests: `python test_cython/runtests.py` - now pass.\r\n\r\nThe is a workaround for (5): `PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/gmpy2 python test_cython/runtests.py`.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nPython 3.11.1+ (heads/3.11:ba88628808, Jan 14 2023, 08:40:06) [GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux\r\nCython version 0.29.33\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "I've bumped into this as well - I would add to this that there is a difference between `python setup.py develop` and `pip install -e .`.\r\n\r\nAt my company we are heavy Cython users and have been transitioning from `python setup.py develop` to `pip install -e .`. This works fine when the package doesn't use PEP-517/PEP-660 (no `pyproject.toml`), because ultimately it just calls `python setup.py develop` under the hood. This isn't desirable of course, as calling `setup.py develop` is deprecated. When the package uses PEP-517 however, imports no longer work.\r\n\r\nI looked into the site-packages folder and found that, with setuptools:\r\n       \r\n - For PEP-517 projects, `pip install -e .` creates a `<library>-<version>.dist-info` folder only.\r\n - For non PEP-517 projects, `pip install -e .` runs `python setup.py develop`, which creates a `library.egg-link` file and adds `<library-absolute-path>` as an entry to `easy-install.pth`.\r\n\r\nIt appears Cython 0.29 only supports the latter. I haven't properly dug into how PEP-660 builds are meant to work, and it is unclear to me if this issue affects all backends implementing PEP-660, or just setuptools. I'm open to the idea that this may be an issue with setuptools, or require further user action to configure properly Cython PEP-517/PEP-660 builds.\r\n\r\nWould really appreciate insight from the Cython team on this!",
