The test failures related to `divmod` calls on `numpy.int64_t` values.\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\nfrom numpy cimport int64_t\n\ncpdef debug_2():\n    cdef int64_t val = -420000000000\n    us, remainder = divmod(val, 1000)\n    if remainder >= 500:\n        us += 1\n    return us\n```\n\nWhich returns `906795` on Windows, Python 3.13t and `-420000000` on all OSs and Python verions\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThey should both produce `-420000000`\n\n### OS\n\nWindows\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13t\n\n### Cython version\n\nmaster\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
