However:\n\nIn order to use freethreading, people have to use the 3.1 alpha. However, if they're aiming to do their \"main\" builds with the current release version of Cython, they can't use `cython.critical_section` because it'll be an error. We could help this by backporting it as a no-op (which is consistent anyway, because it is just a no-op on the regular GIL builds) so that the same code can be used on both versions.\n\n(The  `freethreading_compatible` directive isn't a concern though, because that's usually applied as a comment-directive, and they're just ignored if not understood).\n\n",
