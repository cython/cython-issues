    "body": "### Describe your issue\n\nThere are two intermittent test failures on the CI that it would be nice not to have\r\n\r\n- [x] `bytearray_coercion` on PyPy. This looks like `PyBytearray_AS_BYTES` either isn't returning a `\\0` terminated string, or that the validity of the `char*` it returns isn't being maintained for long enough. We hold a real reference rather than a borrowed reference to the argument so its probably not that. I couldn't reproduce it locally (running about 10 times) with pypy3.10-v7.3.12-linux64, which was picked because it's the most up-to-date version already on my disk.\r\n\r\n    Example of failing output\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    File \"/home/runner/work/cython/cython/TEST_TMP/5/run/c/bytearray_coercion/bytearray_coercion.pypy39-pp73-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\", line ?, in bytearray_coercion.coerce_to_charptr\r\n    Failed example:\r\n        coerced == b or (coerced, b)\r\n    Expected:\r\n        True\r\n    Got:\r\n        (bytearray(b'abc\\x1b\\xf1\\x7f'), bytearray(b'abc'))\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n    @mattip - any thoughts on this one\r\n- [ ] Line profiling on Windows + Python 3.12. I think we're suspicious all forms of profiling on Python 3.12, but line profiling is possibly using the old mechanism to OK. It only looks to fail occasionally on Windows. Example of failing output:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n     ======================================================================\r\n    FAIL: disable_trace (line_trace)\r\n    Doctest: line_trace.disable_trace\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"C:\\hostedtoolcache\\windows\\Python\\3.12.0\\x64\\Lib\\doctest.py\", line 2228, in runTest\r\n        raise self.failureException(self.format_failure(new.getvalue()))\r\n    AssertionError: Failed doctest test for line_trace.disable_trace\r\n      File \"D:\\a\\cython\\cython\\TEST_TMP\\1\\run\\c\\line_trace\\line_trace.cp312-win_amd64.pyd\", line unknown line number, in disable_trace\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    File \"D:\\a\\cython\\cython\\TEST_TMP\\1\\run\\c\\line_trace\\line_trace.cp312-win_amd64.pyd\", line ?, in line_trace.disable_trace\r\n    Failed example:\r\n        disable_trace(py_add, 1, 2, with_sys=True)\r\n    Expected:\r\n        [('call', 0), ('line', 1)]\r\n    Got:\r\n        [('call', 0), ('call', 0)]\r\n    ```\r\n    Output seems reproducible (when it fails). I suspect we're OK  to just disable this test.",
