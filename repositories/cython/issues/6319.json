            "body": "That seems right to me. Cython uses type hints for static typing and `pd.DataFrame` isn't a `dict`. The type hint refers to all uses of the variable and not just the function input. (Note that Cython is also stricter than most type checkers and requires an exact `dict` and not a subclass. But that doesn't apply here).\r\n\r\nIf you want to turn off this behaviour then set the Cython directive `annotation_typing` to `False`.\r\n\r\nObviously pure Python doesn't enforce type hints, but if you ran this code through a type checker like `MyPy` then that would complain to you.",
