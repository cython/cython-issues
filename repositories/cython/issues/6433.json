If they end up in memory buckets of other threads, then we'd potentially lose a lot of performance.\r\n\r\nI'd rather keep them disabled all together, until there's a reason to believe that they are worthwhile. Free-threaded Python lives from the assumption that a bit of per-core performance is worth trading for better parallel performance. Efficient parallel freelists probably need a more sophisticated implementation.",
