I tried to set 'cython_c_in_temp' to true in setup.py but that didn't solve the problem. Is there any way to do so or is it intrinsically impossible ? (I also tried using `kwargs={\"output_dir\":build_dir,\"build_dir\":build_dir,}` in setup.py and also `--build-lib` flag when running setup.py but didn't succeed).",
