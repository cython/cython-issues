It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI've been pinged about a scikit-learn issue (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21654). Essentially `joblib` mmapped arrays aren't aligned (https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/563). It looks like a simple sum over a contiguous memoryview of them can cause a segmentation fault (on some mystery combination of compiler+flags). The memoryview code is very simple so shouldn't impose any \"exotic\" alignment requirements beyond what the C compiler does.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nctypedef fused NUM_TYPES:\r\n    np.npy_float64\r\n    np.npy_float32\r\n    np.npy_int64\r\n    np.npy_int32\r\n\r\ndef _test_sum(NUM_TYPES[::1] x):\r\n    cdef:\r\n        int i\r\n        int n = x.shape[0]\r\n        NUM_TYPES sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        sum += x[i]\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note that initially suspicion fell on a hack to get memoryviews of readonly arrays on Cython<3. That doesn't look to be the culprit)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful to have Cython check if the memory is suitably aligned in the memoryview constructor, and emit an error or warning if isn't.  That could have an optional compiler directive to toggle error/warning/ignore.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nThis is only an attempt to provide a helpful diagnostic message - the fault is really elsewhere. Cython could continue to ignore it.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI haven't looked in too much detail about how to do it, but `alignof` is a C99/C++11 feature. We might not be able to provide this check on older compilers (but I think that's a reasonably limitation)\r\n",
