It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nWe can create directive (off by default) that will automatically populate richcompare if there's way to so this i.e.:\r\nif we have `__eq__` method and `__gt__` then we, first of all, can extrapolate them so we will have `__ne__` as `not __eq__`, and we can push even further, and create `__ge__` as combination of `__eq__ and __gt__`,  `__le__` from from `not __gt__`, and `__lt__` from `not __ge__`\r\n\r\nSo in the end we can write only 2 methods to get full richcompare\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSo if there will be such directive, or maybe better - decorator for class, user can choose to extrapolate full richcompare from several basic methods\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nObviously, we can manually write each of the 6 methods\r\n",
