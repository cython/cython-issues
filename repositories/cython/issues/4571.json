Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen declaring a cpdef enum, its values are also dumped into the module namespace and made accessible from Python. This isn't how normal Python enums work. I also want to avoide cluttering up the modules namespace.\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```cython\r\ncpdef enum letters:\r\n\ta,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j\r\n```\r\nCompile the code, load the extension module from Python and do \"module.a\"\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAll enum values are stored inside the enum (for example letters.a) but not available in the module.\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\nOs: Windows 10 (64-bit)\r\nPython: 3.9.5\r\nCython: 0.29.26\r\n\r\n**Additional context**",
