    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nCython code that works normally fails with a segfault in the limited API. The relevant code involves two base classes in one module and a subclass in another. When the subclass has a `__dealloc__` method it will segfault if built for the limited API.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\nThis comes from python-flint and I made a branch here where I stripped the codebase right down until I had a simple reproducer:\nhttps://github.com/oscarbenjamin/python-flint/tree/tmp_limited_api\n\nWe have two Cython modules defining three classes:\n```cython\n# base.pyx (and identical base.pxd)\n\ncdef class A:\n    pass\n\ncdef class B(A):\n    pass\n```\nThe other module is:\n```cython\n# sub.pyx\n\nfrom base cimport B\n\ncdef class C(B):\n    def __dealloc__(self):\n        pass\n```\nWe test this with:\n```python\n# bug.py\n\nfrom sub import C\n\nprint(1)\nC()\nprint(2)\nprint('End!!!')\n```\nWhen not using the limited API this works fine:\n```console\n$ make test\n...\npython bug.py\n1\n2\nEnd!!!\n```\nWith the limited API it segfaults:\n```console\n$ make test_limited\n...\npython bug.py\n1\nmake: *** [Makefile:8: test_limited] Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n```\nSome notes:\n\n- The crash seems to be when `__dealloc__` is called and goes away if `C.__dealloc__` is removed.\n- All three classes are needed to reproduce the crash.\n- The crash is not seen if all three classes are in the same module.\n\nYou need to make sure that you remove all `.so` files when switching to the limited API build or you end up having both `cpython-313` and `abi3` modules and CPython prefers not to use the `abi3` ones.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nLinux and MacOS\n\n### Python version\n\nCPython 3.13\n\n### Cython version\n\nmaster (08c972c10b7bdecc5f98d28d73d3f466e5b369da) and Cython 3.1.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI was testing Cython 3.1's support for the limited API to see if it was uable for python-flint and it was easy enough to add (https://github.com/flintlib/python-flint/pull/326) and builds fine but segfaults immediately. I have isolated the problem here in a simple reproducer.\n\nI imagine there is a reasonable chance that if this bug was fixed it would mean that python-flint then surfaces some other Cython issue. If any Cython developers are interested in taking a look at python-flint directly I can give instructions for setting up a development environment on the relevant OS (the nontrivial part is just getting `libflint >= 3.0`).",
