For most of them cppreference says:\r\n\r\n> Errors are reported as specified in [math_errhandling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/math_errhandling).\r\n\r\nThis appears to be either the global/thread-local variable `errno` or \"floating point exceptions\" which aren't C++ exception but are essentially a different thread-local error number.\r\n\r\nEither way, no C++ exceptions look to be involved, so we should drop the `except+` (after looking through them to check that my understanding of the exception handling is right for all of them)\r\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\nN/A\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nN/A\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.x, current master\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
