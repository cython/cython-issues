We narrowed down the problem as much as we can. Basically, very big integers makes MSVC (cl.exe) fail to compile the cythonized code. \r\n\r\nYou can see a very basic python script below to reproduce the crash (or here: https://gist.github.com/ozankececioglu/b0bcaeede0b14952eb28c47db841735e).\r\nThe cythonized .c code from 3.0.0b1 can be found here: https://gist.github.com/ozankececioglu/e0f6fe87ba0cfa78f0e1f3dba43a69e0\r\n3.0.0a10 is here: https://gist.github.com/ozankececioglu/61d381f86d949eddebe424dd7a2993a1\r\n\r\nThe cl.exe error we are having with 3.0.0b1:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\ozan\\ws\\cython_fail.c(1754): error C2039: '__pyx_mstate_global': is not a member of '__pyx_mstate'\r\nC:\\Users\\ozan\\ws\\cython_fail.c(1563): note: see declaration of '__pyx_mstate'\r\nerror: command 'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\\\2022\\\\Professional\\\\VC\\\\Tools\\\\MSVC\\\\14.34.31933\\\\bin\\\\HostX64\\\\x64\\\\cl.exe' failed with exit code 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur hunch is, MSVC does not like a very long variable name inside a struct. In the 3.0.0a10, the same variable seems to be defined in a global statement.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# example code\r\nbig_int = 4987677775770777705567775877727067747764603697707784482312707370727377746579652870748702677779367580564477176737780205722456774623774677778779737207277790472074247369772375770497605677127617687117775737717771791797177003701313277130447880079714473771737778664492717497477211878772475778771795577377767077776777772177298975793975577073795437779750715773979127977511722837953078370461277575519762782713874139777777774700743774773770998777437772776198179733909687574772704167777795797966373977780709777877895072797\r\nprint(big_int)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nMSVC compiles successfully. \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10 Pro 21H2\r\nPython version: Python 3.9.16\r\nMSVC version: 14.34.31933 (Visual Studio 2022)\r\nCython version: 3.0.0b1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

            "body": "Thanks for the detailed report and the short reproducer. The difference is that we now (always) put all global names into a module state struct, rather than making them static global C names. See https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/5056\r\n\r\nThis was not a change that is strictly required, but makes it easier for us to support the module initialisation in the CPython Limited API and, more generally (and eventually), features like module reload and subinterpreters, which are based on such a struct that holds the module state.\r\n\r\nApparently, MSVC cannot deal with very long struct field names, although I couldn't quickly find a specific reference for that. The limitations of MSVC have annoyed me (and certainly others) before, so this is just another annoyance on top. There seems to be a general limit for the length of names, but we don't seem to be close to that here (your generated C code uses <700 characters, which seems reasonably below 2048 to even allow for additional name mangling and what not).\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6007568/what-is-max-length-for-an-c-c-identifier-on-common-build-systems\r\n\r\nThe reason why we spell out the integer in the variable/field name is readability. If something goes wrong, you want to be able to understand the constant values used in the C code easily, rather than having to dig through naming indirections first.\r\n\r\nWe could limit the name length here, but then also have to deal with collisions of integer constant names. Probably not overly difficult to do, since we already have to do it for other types of constants. We just didn't need it here before, and it adds complexity. Probably still the best way out.\r\n",
