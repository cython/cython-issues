The same code builds with Python 3.13 on Windows with amd64 and on ubunto-latest and macos-latest. \r\n\r\nThe project does not explicitly use Py_UNICODE but does use array.array('B') and I see [from ](url)https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5982#issuecomment-1955195289 there may be connection. \r\n\r\nError:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/VisualTrueType/actions/runs/12700069355/job/35402026392\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n# example code\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nWindows win32. \n\n### Python version\n\nPython 3.13\n\n### Cython version\n\ncurrent\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
