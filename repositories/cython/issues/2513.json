C-backend, gcc and clang are C99 compliant. As result, for example `inf+inf*j` is  possible.\r\n  2. CPP-backend. As far as I know (don't take my word for it), c++-standard doesn't define the complex multiplication. gcc and clang use C99-variant. A possible result is like above `inf+inf*j`\r\n\r\nThus on Linux + Cython we have the following behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%%cython\r\ndef c_mult(double complex a, double complex b):\r\n    return a*b\r\n\r\n%%cython --cplus\r\ndef cpp_mult(double complex a, double complex b):\r\n    return a*b\r\n\r\na=1.0+0.0j\r\nb=(1.0+1.0j)*float(\"inf\")\r\nprint(\"Python\", a*b)\r\nprint(\"C-Cython\", c_mult(a,b))\r\nprint(\"Cpp-Cython\", cpp_mult(a,b))\r\n```\r\n```\r\nPython (nan+nanj)\r\nC-Cython (nan+nanj)\r\nCpp-Cython (inf+infj)\r\n```\r\n\r\nC-version has the same behavior as CPython, because it uses Cython-fallback. CPP-version uses the native multiplication and the result isn't consistent with other two.\r\n\r\n**On Windows:**\r\n \r\n1. C-backend. MSVC doesn't support complex from C99 (At least with 2015 version), so Cython has to use its fallback here in any case.\r\n2. CPP-backend. The c++-complex multiplication of MSVC doesn't  comply with C99 (via cpp-standard it doesn't have to). It uses the simple formula from the school as far as I understand.\r\n\r\nThus, C-backend and CPP-backend are consistent with CPython implementation on Windows.",
