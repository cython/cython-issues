Please describe.\n\nIn my code, I would like to do CPU dispatch, to detect the available CPU instructions available at runtime and be able to use them.\r\nCPU dispatch is implemented in numpy, [link](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/simd/how-it-works.html). Numba does it too, since it detects the CPU instructions available before JIT compiling the code.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
