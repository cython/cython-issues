If it doesn't then report it as a bug. The generated code should be standard C89 (unless you deliberately use C++ or features from later versions of C) - if the code fails to compile on your OS then report it as a bug. Obviously if a specific Cython library wraps something that doesn't work on your target OS then you're stuck.\r\n\r\nBeyond that I'm not sure what \"compliance\" you're worried about.",
