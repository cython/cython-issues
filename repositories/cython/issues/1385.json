    "body": "Fused function dispatch currently generates a lot of generic code. In most cases, however, the number of distinct fused types in a function signature will be 1 or 2, so a short if-cascade would likely produce less code and be much faster.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch code is generated in `make_fused_cpdef()` in `FusedNode.py`. It generates Cython code. This could be optimised for the common case of a few (positional) arguments by dispatching directly based on the argument types, instead of comparing full signatures in a loop at runtime.\r\n\r\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/829",

I'd like to try working on it as I get the time.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I fully understand the reasons behind the current implementation, though. As far as I can tell, it first attempts to find a matching Cython-space type name for each of the passed Python-object arguments and stores it in `dest_sig`, in the code generated by line `290` of `FusedNode.py` under `._fused_instance_checks()` (as well as analogues for other special-cased objects like Numpy arrays), and then it iterates through and parses the signature of every single available permutation of specializations (presumably at `O(k**n)`), in the code generated around line `700` under `make_fused_cpdef()`, to search for exact matches to the received arguments (with a check to ignore unmatched arguments that are still `None`).\r\n\r\nAssuming that the signatures for all available specializations are known ahead of time, though, and seeing how it's more or less checking for exact matches between `dest_sig` and `signatures.keys()`, why is it not possible or viable to just directly generate the signature of the required specialization from the inferred types of the input arguments in `dest_sig`?",

            "body": "I suppose this issue is officially closed now, but I'd just like to note that AFAIK, even in the best-case scenarios, running a fused `cpdef` no-op function from CPython still takes several times longer than running a statically typed Cython function, a dynamically typed function Python function, or even an untyped Cython function using dynamic calls to `isinstance()` to type local variables at run time.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I noted that the first, \"`instance_checks`\" stage in `.make_fused_cpdef()` that generates a sequence of type name strings for incoming arguments uses quite a bit of list indexing and assignment, which could probably be sped up considerably as a single list comprehension.\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't be too hard to do I think, but there's also a bunch of conditional branching and conditional code generation for conditional branching IIRC, representing a fair bit of special-casing for specific types and external libraries. It's also already `O(n)` IIRC, so I stopped short of trying to change it for #3366.\r\n\r\nIn the ideal scenario, I think it may also be possible to just do a nested `if`-cascade, and skip the string-based signature checking, matching, indexing, and lookup entirely by directly calling the appropriate specialization with appropriately typed arguments. This is a workaround that I'm still using in project code for performance-critical fused `cpdef` functions that accept dynamic arguments, even with `O(n)` dispatch.",
