This is exacerbated when\nsome, let alone many, of these may have sane defaults (but you may want to\noverride the 7th parameter without overriding the 1-6th) and of course\nmakes it easier to forward them from one function to the next. It's trying\nto fake keyword arguments.\n\nContrast this with Python, which actually has real keywords arguments that\nhandle this perfectly. (If one wants to forward this, it's typically more\nPythonic to use keyword arguments to initialize the config object itself,\nrather than create it then set attributes.) Add to this that in Python,\nunlike C, objects are passed by reference by default, making it more\ndangerous to just mutate them without defensively making a copy. And\nimmutable objects certainly have their benefits [1].\n\nFor these reasons, it's often not the best approach to simply mirror the\nC++ API when wrapping a library.\n\n[1] https://www.google.se/search?q=benefits+of+immutable+objects\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Sep 15, 2018 at 6:41 PM Antoine Pitrou <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I don't see the point of immutability here.
