    "body": "Currently, non-constant default values on CyFunctions are stored in a struct and accessed through a void pointer together with a couple of housekeeping values needed to use it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/aea4e6b84b38223c540266f8c57093ee2039f284/Cython/Utility/CythonFunction.c#L55-L57\r\n\r\n(We then store the introspectable `__defaults__` and `__kwdefaults__` as separate `PyObjects*`).\r\n\r\nThis works, but requires multiple awkward loops over it in a few places\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/aea4e6b84b38223c540266f8c57093ee2039f284/Cython/Utility/CythonFunction.c#L625-L626\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/aea4e6b84b38223c540266f8c57093ee2039f284/Cython/Utility/CythonFunction.c#L668-L669\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/aea4e6b84b38223c540266f8c57093ee2039f284/Cython/Utility/CythonFunction.c#L1258-L1259\r\n\r\nI'd like to replace this struct with a `cdef class`, generated in a similar way to the closure class. My view is:\r\n\r\n**Advantages**\r\n\r\n1. It simplifies the implementation of CyFunction - it keeps track of one `PyObject*` for the defaults and everything else is handled automatically using the tried-and-tested code that handles our cdef classes.\r\n2. It makes it much easier to pickle the defaults - https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4368 can't currently handle this. (This is the immediate reason I was thinking about it).\r\n3. It potentially makes it easier for the introspectable `__defaults__` and `__kwdefaults__` to be linked back to the stored defaults - https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2650. The logic to do this could be on the `cdef class`, which could act as a dictionary-like proxy for example. I wouldn't propose to do this on the initial implementation but it's easier to see how to do it in future.\r\n4. There are a few bugs in the current implementation relating to c++ classes, which are mainly just memory leaks, but could also be crashes:\r\n    ```cython\r\n    # distutils: language=c++\r\n    \r\n    from libcpp.vector cimport vector\r\n    \r\n    # neither the constructor nor destructor of the default vector are ever called\r\n    # surprisingly this doesn't actually crash it on my PC, but this is pure luck...\r\n    def f(vector[int] a=[1,2,3]):\r\n        return sum(ai for ai in a)\r\n    \r\n    from cython cimport floating\r\n    \r\n    class C:\r\n        # binding of fused functions causes the defaults to be copied by memcpy\r\n        # which is absolutely invalid. This only avoids problems because the\r\n        # destructor is never called...\r\n        def f(self, floating dummy, vector[int] a=[1,2,3]):\r\n            return sum(ai+dummy for ai in a)\r\n    ```\r\n    `cdef class` already has the infrastructure to get this right.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages**\r\n\r\nGenerating a new (internal) `cdef class` does require more code than generating a struct, so it probably gives larger C files and increases compilation times.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm not planning to do this right away, but I wanted to post it to give people opportunity to tell me that I'm wrong. It's possible that the cython-devel list might have been the better place to post it",
