    "body": "In the codebase there are a lot of places, where an argument for a function is not used. On most compilers this warning is suppressed using the `CYTHON_UNUSED` macro. However since MSVC does not have a similar feature to `__attribute__((unused))`, this causes warnings on MSVC. I think the most straightforward way to fix this would a macro like:\r\n```cpp\r\n#define  CYTHON_UNUSED_ARG(identifier) /*Empty*/\r\n```\r\nI was not sure, whether there was a specific reason, why we would like to keep the identifier in there and just suppress it using `__attribute__((unused))`. In case there is a reason to keep the identifier, it could use\r\n```\r\n#define  CYTHON_UNUSED_ARG(identifier) CYTHON_UNUSED identifier\r\n```\r\nin those cases. However I do not really see a reason, why it would be helpful to keep it.\r\nI am willing to implement this change, but looking for feedback, before I actually change it.",
