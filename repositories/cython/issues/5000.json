Please describe.\r\n\r\nAutomatically generated properties that convert from C/C++ types are a bit dubious - they rarely behave how the user expects:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef class C:\r\n    cdef public vector[int] vec\r\n    cdef public CStruct struc\r\n\r\ndef f(C c):\r\n  c.vec[0] = 1  # but changes don't propagate back\r\n  c.struc['field'] = 2  # same here...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nFor C properties only I'd like to change the return types:\r\n\r\n* anything that would return a list returns a tuple\r\n* anything that would return a dict returns a \"mappingproxy\" (on Python versions where it's available)\r\n\r\nThe logic being that these types can't be modified so that the user gets an early warning about their attempts to modify the return value, rather than silently believing it works.\r\n\r\nI'm not proposing to change the return types to/from a function for example\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nThe other potential option is a compile-time warning.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
