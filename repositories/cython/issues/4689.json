    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThis relates to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4280 (where it's unclear what exception specification should be assumed for function pointers). In my mind a `noexcept` function is compatible with a pointer with an `except *` or an `except ?value` pointer specification (but not an `except value` or `except +` specification). This is because it simply adds an unnecessary check that always passes.\r\n\r\nSimilarly an `except value` function should be compatible with `except *` and an `except ?value` specification. (And a few other similar combinations)\r\n\r\nCode to demonstrate (that doesn't currently work):\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from *:\r\n    cdef int extern_f()  # noexcept\r\n\r\ncdef int takes_func(int (*f)() except *):\r\n    return f()\r\n\r\ndef call():\r\n    takes_func(extern_f)  # fails, but shouldn't\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with what C++ does (which doesn't necessarily say anything about what Cython should do...)\r\n```c++\r\nint noexcept_func() noexcept;\r\nint regular_func();\r\n\r\nint (*f)() = noexcept_func;  // OK\r\nint (*g)() = regular_func; // OK\r\nint (*h)() noexcept = noexcept_func; // OK\r\nint (*i)() noexcept = regular_func; // fails\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe advantage to this is that we could assume `except *` for function pointers by default and the vast majority of code would keep working.\r\n\r\nI think it's probably worth doing independently whatever we decide on https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4280 (and thus I create a separate issue)\r\n",
