There shouldn't be a difference between .py and .pyx files here. But I can see that these functions have issues. It seems easy for `cython.pointer()`, which always needs a C type as argument. The same might apply to `cython.typedef()` and maybe other C-ish operations. But what is the meaning of\r\n```python\r\nx = cython.declare(int)\r\ny: int\r\n```\r\nThe second definitely refers to a Python `int`, but the first? The difference is that the first declares a static variable (when used globally), whereas the second only declares a regular Python global variable. That difference goes away for local variables, though.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it should be rare for users to mix both inside of functions, but there seems to be benefit in using both at the global module level. It doesn't feel wrong to expect C types for a static C variable. But it's probably a gotcha where code doesn't quite do what you might expect when you look at it.",
