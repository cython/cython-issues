There were a couple of patches I needed to make to distutils to get things to work. I thought you may want to know about this.\r\n\r\n[aside].

I believe it's possible to end up in trouble if you mix up incompatible bits of the C standard library (e.g. file pointers).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't think any of the core devs use Cython on Windows much do we're not really in a position to recommend \"the right way\" ourselves.",
