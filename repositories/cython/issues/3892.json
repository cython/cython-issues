So, while installing cython via pip on aarch64, pip builds wheel for same resulting in it takes more time to install cython. Making wheel available for aarch64 will benefit aarch64 users by minimizing cython installation time.\r\n\r\n**Expected Output**\r\nPip should be able to download cython wheel from PyPI repository rather than building it from source code.\r\n\r\n@cython-team, please let me know if I can help you building wheel/uploading to PyPI repository. I am curious to make cython wheel available for aarch64. It will be a great opportunity for me to work with you.\r\n",

It should normally just take the platform agnostic wheel, unless it finds a platform specific one. Since the pure Python wheel is much smaller, it may actually be faster and not slower to download and install it, especially on a typical ARM machine.",
