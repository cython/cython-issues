On Python versions that don't have them, this will fail. Even if users were referring to them conditionally, e.g. based on a Python version check, the module import will still fail because we are always looking up the builtins that we find, not just the ones that are actually (conditionally or not) used at runtime.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should have a second list of builtins for which we ignore lookup failures at module init time, and then allow those globals to be `NULL` and check for that on use.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Someone stole my time machine keys. Probably myself, in the future. There's already a `uncachable_builtins` list in Code.py. I've updated it for Py3.13.",
