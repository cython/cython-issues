If pydantic is interested in functions to analyse, I'd rather suggest looking at the source file path or the code object. The mere fact that a function is compiled doesn't mean it's not interesting, at least in the case of Cython. The source might still be available and decorators/annotations/etc. might have been used just normally.\n",
