It would be very desirable from a clarity/readability/maintenance perspective to unify the code for those two methods.\r\n\r\nI tried unifying these functions, but there was a perf-hit for the simpler case (no inverse) of about 10%, which is too much for just always calculating it by default for such a central method.\r\n\r\nI then tried (very naively) to get cython to compile the different code branches as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def _unique(self, ndarray[object] values, bint return_inverse=False):\r\n        [...]\r\n        with nogil:\r\n            for i in range(n):\r\n                [actual computation]\r\n                if return_inverse:\r\n                    [calculate inverse]\r\n\r\n    def unique(self, ndarray[object] values, bint return_inverse=False):\r\n        # define separate functions with/without inverse to force compilation\r\n        # of the different code paths for boolean \"return_inverse\"\r\n        if return_inverse:\r\n            return self._unique_with_inverse(values)\r\n        return self._unique_no_inverse(values)\r\n\r\n    def _unique_no_inverse(self, const {{dtype}}_t[:] values):\r\n        return self._unique(values, return_inverse=False)\r\n\r\n    def _unique_with_inverse(self, const {{dtype}}_t[:] values):\r\n        return self._unique(values, return_inverse=True)\r\n```\r\nbut the perf penalty remained.\r\n\r\nSumming up, it would be awesome to be able to do something like (the example below borrows from `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, but the exact syntax is not relevant to me):\r\n```\r\n    @cython.force_compile('return_inverse', [False])\r\n    def unique(self, ndarray[object] values, bint return_inverse=False):\r\n        [...]\r\n        with nogil:\r\n            for i in range(n):\r\n                [compute]\r\n                if return_inverse:\r\n                    [calculate inverse]\r\n```\r\nwith the idea being to *both* unify the code *and* maintain perf in the case where the `return_inverse`-branch doesn't need to be touched at all.",

This sounds like a complicated addition to the language best taken up on the mailing list. \r\n\r\nHowever, for your use, I don't think you'd need it. First, given your use of {{dtype}} I assume you're already using templates to auto-generate code at a higher level, so it shouldn't be too bad to leverage this templating functionality to explicitly generate to copies of this function parameterized on {{return_inverse}}.

Not sure how easy it would be to auto-template on a variable - I guess a necessary restriction would be, that the value needs to be `const`.\r\n\r\nIn general, the ``{{dtype}}`` (and other) templating is not the most ideal solution - for the former, there's fused types at least, which allows to write code much more natively.\r\n\r\nSo for the latter, it would be great to be able to avoid templating as well; e.g. do something like\r\n```\r\n@cython.force_compile('parameter_c', [val1, val2])\r\ndef some_function(parameter_a, parameter_b, parameter_c)\r\n    [do stuff]\r\n```\r\nand have it *internally* compile to the equivalent of\r\n```\r\ndef some_function(parameter_a, parameter_b, parameter_c)\r\n    if parameter_c == val1:\r\n        return some_function_fc_p2_v0(parameter_a, parameter_b)\r\n    elif parameter_c == val2:\r\n        return some_function_fc_p2_v1(parameter_a, parameter_b)\r\n    # general case\r\n    [do stuff]\r\n```\r\nwhere `some_function_fc_p2_v0` is **f**orce **c**ompiled with **p**arameter 2 set to **v**alue 0, etc.\r\n",
