    "body": "[PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/) defines dataclasses, a new feature in Py3.7. It would be nice if Cython could generate equivalent code for cdef classes directly at translation time when it finds an `@dataclass` constructor on them.\r\n\r\nThis can be done by generating Cython code and injecting it into the module, similar to what we do for fused types (see `FusedNode.py`) or auto-pickling (see the `AnalyseDeclarationsTransform` in `ParserTreeTransforms.py`). The latter would probably also be a good place to implement the `@dataclass` decorator, although it seems worth keeping the main part of the implementation in a separate module instead of the transform itself, e.g. `Cython.Compiler.Dataclasses`.\r\n\r\nSince this only applies to cdef classes, it seems better to use a safe and dedicated separate decorator `@cython.dataclass` than to rely on the generic Python decorator, at least initially.",

            "body": "I have a 60% complete implementation of this. A few design questions:\r\n\r\nWhat attributes should be included? Definitely annotated variables. Maybe regular `cdef` variables?\r\n\r\nWhat should the visibility of the attributes be? There's a few options:\r\n1. Default to invisible, like for a standard `cdef class`. This is obviously consistent. The issue with this is that there's a few functions in the `dataclasses` module like [`asdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.asdict) which assume that every attribute declared in `__dataclass_fields__` is readable. If they aren't then the classes won't be compatible with those interfaces.\r\n\r\n     If so, should non-public attributes be omitted from `__dataclass_fields__`? This seems inconsistent since they do appear in the destructor, the repr, and affect the comparisons.\r\n\r\n2. Default to visible. This is inconsistent with the standard `cdef class` behaviour, but would make them as compatible as possible with standard `dataclasses`. It would also make sense for most use-cases I think. One problem is that the syntax doesn't really exist of override that (only `public` and `readonly` are defined).\r\n\r\n3. Annotated variables default to visible, `cdef` variables to invisible? It kind of makes sense and gives a way to control visibility, but it seems a little odd to me.\r\n\r\nThe likely implementation deviates from the normal `cdef class` behaviour where\r\n```\r\ncdef class C:\r\n   a: `int` = 0\r\n```\r\nmakes a class variable. I think this is unavoidable and makes sense in this case, but any other ideas?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nNone of these questions are major blockers for progressing on it though.",
