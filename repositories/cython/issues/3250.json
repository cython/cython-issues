    "body": "Recently I am making a tool that allows you to build just one Python extension that contains multiple Cython modules, and I need to call the PyInit functions of embedded Cython modules.\r\nMy tool works with any modules that compile to C code, but if they compile to C++, I get a compiler error that the symbol PyInit for this module can't be found. It tells me about a similar symbol with, but I think it's mangled.\r\nWhen I checked a C++ module, the PyInit function seemed to be declared as extern C.\r\nMaybe the problem is that extern C only works if I were to include the Cython files directly, and not link to there .o file.\r\nOne idea, assuming Cython puts a list of the same functions at the top of each file, add an option to not add those functions and instead, to put those into an include file. Then in theory, I can include the Cython module, making the resulting extension noticeably smaller in the process.\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\nAlso, thanks for Cython, I use it a lot and it's great which was why I wanted to make this tool.",
