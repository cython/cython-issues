    "body": "### Describe your issue\n\nUsing critical sections in Cython has some unexpected usability issues. To be clear, these issues mostly stem from how critical section work by themselves, not by how Cython has implemented them. However, because Cython sometimes hides calls to the C API, thread safety bugs where a critical section get released under one's nose become easier to miss and harder to debug. In general, we've been operating under the assumption that any call to the C API can release a critical section mainly due to two reasons:\n\n- Any call to the C API can lead to unexpected code running which might or might not release the critical section.\n- C APIs that currently do not release a critical section could be changed in the future and release it.\n\nMore specific suggestions:\n\n1. There's the issue that @ngoldbaum raised in #7317 (probably more of a \"bug\" than a usability issue) that should be fixed by #7321.\n2. Using `cython.critical_section` as a decorator like it's documented in the [critical section docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/freethreading.html#critical-sections) will always lead to a call to the C API to construct the Python object to return, which could lead to the critical section unexpectedly getting released. I think it's probably a good idea to disallow this as well.\n3. When using `cython.critical_section` as a context manager, would it be a good idea to warn against code that would call into the C API? We can always think of ways to disable such warnings, but, in the general case, these would be helpful.\n\ncc @ngoldbaum @da-woods @rgommers for thoughts",

For everything else you're probably right that Cython's a little too opaque to be able to reason effectively about where the critical section might get broken which makes them not particularly useful (especially to people who don't have the knowledge to really inspect the generated C code).\n\n> Using cython.critical_section as a decorator like it's documented in the [critical section docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/freethreading.html#critical-sections) will always lead to a call to the C API to construct the Python object to return, which could lead to the critical section unexpectedly getting released. I think it's probably a good idea to disallow this as well.\n\nI tend to disagree with this specific point - In most cases I think you'd generally be relaxed about the final conversion to the Python object - you'd typically have read and processed the data correctly in a thread-safe way and the conversion would _usually_ be on some local temporary. Additionally, it's also pretty unlikely that the conversion function would try to acquire a critical section on the `self` argument thus causing a deadlock. (Although this last point is very much an implementation detail of critical sections, and something where things are generally _less_ thread-safe in a GIL world).\n\nIn https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6766 I proposed warning on two related things that I think are big footguns - critical sections on methods of a Python (non-cdef) class are basically useless and Python attribute access (via `PyObject_GetAttr`) almost always breaks the critical section.\n\nMy current feeling is that adding warnings on all Python operations would be too much. But I could be wrong and am happy to hear other opinions.\n\nI wonder if we should be promoting pymutex as the first choice rather than critical sections in the documentation?",
