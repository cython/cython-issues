    "body": "It would be nice for Cython to check if a file can be safely overridden when generating `.c` or `.cpp` files.\r\n\r\nThis can easily be done by checking the first line for `\"/* Generated by Cython ...\"` or a similiar flag.\r\nIf that line is missing, the build process should be stopped and a warning should be emitted, forcing the user to either manually check and delete the files or to pass an yet-to-introduce flag which disables this behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe scenario which led me to open this issue:\r\n1) I'm implementing some performance-critical sections directly in a `.cpp` file\r\n2) Classes used to interact with Python are exposed in identically named `.h` and `.pxd` files.\r\n3) One of the classes required an Extension Class, forcing me to create a `.pyx` file.\r\n4) Me forgetting that `conda-develop -b` builds inplace by default, resulted in the newly generated `.cpp` file overwritting one day's worth of work.\r\n\r\nI think this is a relatively easy to implement feature, which could prevent some frustration in the future.",
