This would typically be to fix some OS-dependent issues with an appropriate `#define`.\r\n\r\nThis would be relatively easy to implement but I'm not sure about a good syntax. The first that comes to my mind is an empty include file (making the mental association that the Cython file is still empty at the point where the code would be inserted):\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from \"\":\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    /* This code appears before Cython's #include <Python.h> */\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```",
