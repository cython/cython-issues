[this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/overview/visual-cpp-language-conformance?view=msvc-170) states (I could not find a link to the actual paragraph):\r\n> MSVC doesn't support the _Complex keyword or native complex types. The Universal CRT <complex.h> uses implementation-specific macros to achieve the same effect. For more information, see [C complex math support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/complex-math-support?view=msvc-170).\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# example code\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will try to fill this in later, there must be a failing test already in Cython...\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nOn MSVC, the typedef needs to be `typedef _FComplex __pyx_t_float_complex;`, see [this table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/complex-math-support?view=msvc-170#types-used-in-complex-math)\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nany\r\n\r\n### Cython version\r\n\r\n0.29.26, 3.0.0, master\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I'd be prepared to update the typedefs, but not actually change Cython to use `CYTHON_CCOMPLEX=1` by default (although if Numpy wants to do so, then that's your choice). I think doing that is safe because it shouldn't break any existing code.\r\n\r\nI'll try to prepare a PR for this this weekend. I'll leave the final judgement on whether to include it to Stefan though.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIn terms of Numpy's immediate use, I suspect you could use the fallback struct and just do a cast (they should have the same memory layout as all the compiler implementations) but that may not be pretty.",

            "body": "I think you tagged someone with a similar (but different) name to me - hopefully they aren't too upset by having to think about MSVC complex numbers :).\r\n\r\nThe big thing that's missing from the MSVC support is the basic arithmetic operators.  While we have fallback implementations of those in Cython (for the case where we use our own complex type), I can't see a way to use them quickly and simply.  I'm sure it's possible but it's gone a bit beyond \"a quick change that I feel comfortable sneaking into the 3.0 release candidate\".\r\n\r\nI'll have a bit more of a think about it and if I come up with anything I'll give it another go.\r\n\r\nI should also add, I think we use non-standard gcc extensions too, so it's not 100% microsoft's fault.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "Thanks a lot for taking a stab at this. It's challenging indeed.\r\n\r\nI think the proper fix here is not to check for `_Complex_I` under MSVC. I'm referring to the code snippet over here: https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/52cba8252b3527f0ca998378ba9bd2b8d5d9ee64/Cython/Utility/Complex.c#L4-L13\r\n\r\nThis appears to be wrong, cause MSVC does not support the `_Complex` keyword, but it *does* define the `_Complex_I` macro. How would you feel about falling back to the Cython structure under MSVC, i.e. change the above snippet to this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#if !defined(CYTHON_CCOMPLEX) \r\n  #if defined(__cplusplus) \r\n    #define CYTHON_CCOMPLEX 1 \r\n  #elif (defined(_Complex_I) && !defined(_MSC_VER)) || ((defined (__STDC_VERSION__) && __STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L) && !defined(__STDC_NO_COMPLEX__)) \r\n    // <complex.h> should exist since C99, but only C11 defines a test to detect it \r\n    #define CYTHON_CCOMPLEX 1 \r\n  #else \r\n    #define CYTHON_CCOMPLEX 0 \r\n  #endif \r\n#endif \r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that I have limited experience with Cython and its handling of complex number, so I might be misunderstanding something here.",
