A lot of these macros (and former macros) are in the Limited API, but aren't in the stable ABI (because they're macros and there's nothing to link to).\n\nAt least for `Py_REFCNT` it looks to be a static inline function before 3.14 https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c91c373ef6ceab78936d866572023feb642acc73/Include/refcount.h#L96 so should be fine. `Py_SET_REFCNT` looks similar. \n\nIt's all pretty badly documented in Python but I think it's (probably) fine. I've definitely looked into some similar functions before.",
