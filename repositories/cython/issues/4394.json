    "body": "In short, we're seeing a segfault for a pickle-related line of code when using `Cython >= 3.0a5`, but not stable release or pre-release versions prior to that. The original issue description downstream is https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/14732, but I will also paste the problematic code block for quick inspection (from Ralf's original description)--the last line below segfaults:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def test_pickleable(self):\r\n        # Make sure we can pickle and unpickle the interpolant without any\r\n        # changes in the behavior.\r\n        seq = Halton(1, scramble=False, seed=np.random.RandomState())\r\n\r\n        x = 3*seq.random(50)\r\n        xitp = 3*seq.random(50)\r\n\r\n        y = _1d_test_function(x)\r\n\r\n        interp = self.build(x, y)\r\n\r\n        yitp1 = interp(xitp)\r\n        yitp2 = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(interp))(xitp)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile that doesn't exactly give you an isolated/minimal reproducer since it is buried in the depths of SciPy, perhaps you have suggestions for avoiding the segfault? For now, I'll propose using `<3.0a5` in our pre-release tests in the absence of another way to avoid the segfault: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/14801\r\n\r\nAlthough I did bisect Cython versions carefully with the reproducer below, I did not yet check to see if the usage of multiple threads by the test suite was contributing to the problem:\r\n\r\n`python runtests.py -t \"scipy/interpolate/tests/test_rbfinterp.py\" -- -n 2`",
