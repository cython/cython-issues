In order to use the typing annotations, py35 would be required.  I think its a value trade off of the usefulness of Cython going forward and the ability to gain contributions to drop support for those versions (they will forever be able to use prior versions of cython).\r\n\r\nalmost no one relies on 3.4 that cant move to 3.5, so the question is how much effort tradeoff there is in supporting 2.7 (which - is end of life)\r\n\r\n",

They're kind of nice for simple arguments (on the level of `a: str`, or `node: Node`), but even `Optional[Node]` is about the limit of complexity for me.  For me an argument doesn't have to be very polymorphic for the annotation to turn into pure useless noise.\r\n\r\nSo personally, I kind of hope they're used in a pretty restrained way in the Cython code-base.

Several arguments are so ubiquitous (e.g. `pos`, `node`, `scope` or `type`) that I'd rather not clutter the signatures with type annotations for them. That would be really annoying. Their names are so short and clear enough that they'd suffer from additional (annotation) screen space. And the remaining arguments, well, not sure if they are worth adding annotations. Some might be, but I'd generally prefer seeing less here than more.\r\n\r\nI don't think the Py2 support is the reason why Cython does not use annotations in its code base.",

Something like\r\n`analyse_types(self, env: Scope)`\r\nwould be largely redundant, for example. If you don't know that `analyse_types()` is passed a `Scope`, then you probably don't know what `analyse_types()` does and how it works, and should rather read its documentation. The same applies to the abundance of methods that accept a `node`. I wouldn't want type annotations for those all over the place.

Just because you are able to pass a value of the right type into a function does not mean that you are doing something reasonable already. And just knowing what type you have in your hands does not enable you to do something sensible with it right there.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I think IDEs should be smart enough to deduce type information from base class methods (and if they aren't, then it's a bug on their side). Maybe we can get away with adding type information to the relevant methods in `Node` and `ExprNode` only? If we only add them to places where no-one ever looks, bloating their signatures won't hurt much. :)\r\n",

A large part of my work on Cython is in these methods (in subtypes). I expect that to be similar for new contributors.\r\n\r\n\r\n> cython can ship annotations like typeshed ships them - in separate pyi files\r\n\r\nNo, please. That is a huge mess. We'll just permanently forget to update them and have CI failing each time just for that. It's bad enough that we have `.pxd` files next to the `.py` files that we compile – I permanently forget to update those, too. (BTW, they contain type information already. I would guess that PyCharm Professional and the like should be able to pick them up.)\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also the initial work of typing the whole repo can be done easily using `pyannotate`\r\n\r\nI don't think automatic annotation tools will help with adding type annotations selectively to a couple of important methods. They certainly cannot decide where they don't get in the way for human readers. We simple *know* what types go into these methods since the argument names are obvious. We can add type annotations by hand.",

A large part of my work on Cython is in these methods (in subtypes). I expect that to be similar for new contributors.\r\n\r\nI guess I am not quite sure what methods are you talking about\r\n\r\n",
