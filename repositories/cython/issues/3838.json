Please describe.**\r\nAs was pointed out in #3829 when we were updating `NameNode.declare_from_annotation()`, PEP 526 [supports assigning an `__annotations__` dict to a module scope](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/#runtime-effects-of-type-annotations) as well, however we're explicitly ignoring annotations at the module scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThis would provide the following functionality:\r\n```cython\r\n# foo.py\r\n\r\nbar: str = \"bar\"\r\n\r\nprint(__annotations__)\r\n#> {'bar': 'str'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# other_module.py\r\n\r\nimport foo\r\n\r\nprint(foo.__annotations__)\r\n#> {'bar': 'str'}\r\n```\r\n",
