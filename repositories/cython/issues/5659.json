It does not support the limited API, so any tests that use `-DCYTHON_LIMITED_API=1` (like `tests/run/isolated_limited_api_tests.srctree`) will not work. A few choices:\r\n- add the specific limited-API tests to the `tests/pypy_bugs.txt`. What will happen as more and more tests are converted to use the limited-API?\r\n- undefine `CYTHON_LIMITED_API` for PyPy, then PyPy will run the test as if it does not limit the API\r\n- skip the limited-API-specific tests in the [runtests.py lambda](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/1cde6233a58538c146a16adcb38496c8e81b0b78/runtests.py#L509) for PyPy.",
