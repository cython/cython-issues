For clean transpilation it seems that `step` needs to known at cythonization time, i.e. it should be replaced by a literal integer.\r\n\r\nIt probably doesn't matter for this issue, but my solution to the sub-optimal code generation problem above is to use the following construct whenever I have a `range()` with 3 dynamic arguments:\r\n```cython\r\ni = start - step\r\nfor _ in range(((stop - start) + (step - 1))//step):\r\n    i += step\r\n    ...     \r\n```\r\n",
