    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nA very minor code-generation inefficiency.... In general literal defaults don't generate a \"defaults\" structure but instead are just used directly in the wrapper function. For fused functions though the default is hidden behind a CloneNode, a ProxyNode, and a CoerceToTempNode (https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/7537910a2d2e3892359ef639fe9262f017634461/Cython/Compiler/FusedNode.py#L845) which means they are detected as non-literal and so always generate the defaults structure.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced by me in https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/f6eeeda534dd1139a7ea35bfa627db1789082b06 (possibly... they'd have been hidden behind a CloneNode before that anyway I think...).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't stop anything from working, but means that a simple fused function is slightly more complicated than a non-fused function.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\ncimport cython\r\n\r\ndef f(double x=1.0):\r\n    return x*2\r\n\r\ndef g(cython.floating x=1.0):\r\n    return x*2\r\n```\r\n\r\nInspecting the C code, note that `f` just handles the default as:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nPyObject* values[1] = {0};\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile `g` generates defaults structs.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Cython version: master\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm actually not inclined to fix this. It's a minor inefficiency. There's also an argument for *always* using the defaults structure (since it might allow full-Python behaviour like modifying the defaults at runtime)",
