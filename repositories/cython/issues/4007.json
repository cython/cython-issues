I had not expected that even cdef classes would have restrictions on their field types. I'll have to modify the Cython codegen for [Spiral](https://github.com/mrakgr/The-Spiral-Language) to accommodate this restriction. Much like with arrays, each time I do an `object` instead of a more precise type that will result in runtime type checking that could have been avoided.\r\n\r\nI actually don't dare to do unchecked casts as the codegen can have bugs on occasion.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd prefer that stack tuples get implemented, but this should be allowed as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'll print them as objects for the time being.",
