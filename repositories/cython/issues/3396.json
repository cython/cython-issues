However, I could not import the module with error as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import demo\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"demo.pyx\", line 1, in init demo\r\n    #cython: language_level = 3\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'View'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI searched in **demo.c** file emitted by cython and found that the error occurred in one of the module's initialization function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic int __Pyx_modinit_type_init_code(void)\r\n...\r\n __pyx_t_1 = PyImport_ImportModule(\"View.MemoryView\"); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_1)) __PYX_ERR(1, 1, __pyx_L1_error)\r\n__Pyx_GOTREF(__pyx_t_1);\r\n__pyx_array_type = __Pyx_ImportType(__pyx_t_1, \"View.MemoryView\", \"array\", sizeof(struct __pyx_array_obj), __Pyx_ImportType_CheckSize_Warn);\r\n```\r\nCython tried to import \"View.MemoryView\" using Python's default import routines. Since there was not any View module in search path ==> import fail.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not understand why Cython tried to import array type from other module. All information needed to create cython.array was already in the .c file. It only need to call PyModule_AddObject to add cython.array type to new module.\r\n\r\nWhat did I do wrong or is that a bug?\r\n\r\nI used Python 3.7.4 on MacOs, Cython 0.29.15.",
