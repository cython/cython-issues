Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI will make a minimal working example to explain the error:\r\n\r\ntest.pxd \r\n```cython\r\ncdef public int cy_exported()\r\n```\r\n\r\ntest.pyx\r\n```cython\r\ncimport test\r\n\r\ncdef public int cy_exported():\r\n    return 3\r\n\r\ncdef public int cy_unexported():\r\n    return 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompiling with: `cython -Wextra -3 test.pyx` results in this header:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n__PYX_EXTERN_C int __pyx_f_4test_cy_exported(void);\r\n__PYX_EXTERN_C int cy_unexported(void);\r\n...\r\n```\r\nObviously, the cy_exported name is mangled while the cy_unexported name is not. That means that `cy_unexported` can be used directly from C but not `cy_exported` and `cy_exported` can be used from other parts of Cython but not `cy_unexported`. In my opinion the mangling should never took plays in public functions, so cy_exported can be used from both, Cython and C.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround that I found is to announce the generated header again to Cython:\r\n\r\nsomeotherfile.pyx\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from 'test.h':\r\n    int cy_unexported()\r\n```\r\nThis works, but is clearly a workaround.\r\n    \r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Python version: 3.7\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.21\r\n",
