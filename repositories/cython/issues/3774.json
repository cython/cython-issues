In the master branch `expl` got added to `libc/math.pdx` in [this commit](https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/4f9e2e37eb06de526938c428f35a355cdcc466f3) on May 7. However, this change has not been included in a release as of v0.29.21. Was this done intentional? I would be very happy about support for long double C-math functions in future releases since I was hoping to make use of this in a Python package...   \r\n\r\nAs of v0.29.21 trying to build a .pyx with:\r\n```from libc.math cimport expl```\r\nthrows:\r\n```'libc\\math\\expl.pxd' not found```.\r\n",
