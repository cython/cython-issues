Please describe.\n\nCPython 3.14 adds a function `PyMutex_IsLocked()` that is handy when it is unknown whether the mutex has been locked.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nWe should add a third method, `pymutex.is_locked()`, in addition to `.acquire()` and `.release()`.\n```cython\ncdef cython.pymutex mutex\n\nassert not mutex.is_locked()\nmutex.acquire()\nassert mutex.is_locked()\nmutex.release()\n```\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nA drawback is that this method would only work in Py3.14 whereas `PyMutex` is available in Py3.13+. It's unclear how the method should behave in older versions. We might simply require users to do a version check and implement the method as e.g. `Py_FatalError()` in older CPython versions (<3.14).\n\nWe should also try if we can implement the method in CPython 3.13, using exposed CPython internals. Py3.13 does not change any more, so what works now will probably continue to work in future 3.13.x releases. CPython uses this in `Include/cpython/pylock.h`:\n```c\nstatic inline int\n_PyMutex_IsLocked(PyMutex *m)\n{\n    return (_Py_atomic_load_uint8(&m->_bits) & _Py_LOCKED) != 0;\n}\n#define PyMutex_IsLocked _PyMutex_IsLocked\n```",

(Although personally I find `is_locked` clearer).\n\n> Py3.13 does not change any more, so what works now will probably continue to work in future 3.13.x releases.\n\nI think it actually can't change now. The checks are inlined into `PyMutex_Lock` (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/eec9257aa57a195bc7b704cd502ecb6bc439f9e1/Include/cpython/lock.h#L48) and so even if they wanted to they couldn't change them for a future 3.13 release.\n\nPractically I don't know how useful this function actually is - it's only really for `assert` and maybe choosing to do other work first if it looks like a lock is used. But there's no reason not to have it if we can.",
