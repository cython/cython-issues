For example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0d0cc9987f1c7e4d757d974be681e0288f0640e9/Cython/Utility/Printing.c#L23\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0d0cc9987f1c7e4d757d974be681e0288f0640e9/Cython/Utility/ImportExport.c#L347\r\n\r\n(but also loads of other similar places).\r\n\r\nI don't really understand these - in most cases the argument type is `const char*` so the cast seems unnecessary, and just serves to generate warnings about casting away a constant. I'd like to remove them, but they've presumably been put there for a reason.",
