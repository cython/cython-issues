            "body": "We have a design discussion involving several internal & external projects. Part of the design involves allowing users to pass a Python object to an external C library (which could potentially be wrapped via Cython and exposed to Python users). The design aims to provide flexibility for users. So, for example, this is the *class* of use cases that we are evaluating: \r\n```python\r\ncdef extern from *:\r\n    # an external library API\r\n    int my_func(void* ptr, double x)\r\n\r\ncpdef my_func_wrapper(my_obj, double x, is_ok):\r\n    # Note: my_obj may not be actually a Python object; is_ok conveys this information\r\n    cdef void* ptr = <void*>my_obj\r\n    with nogil(is_ok):\r\n        # internally, there is a mechanism to allow my_func to access the Python object,\r\n        # but to do so the GIL must be held\r\n        status = my_func(ptr, x)\r\n    if status != 0:\r\n        raise MyError(...)\r\n```\r\nwhich is currently not possible. I imaginee the proposed usage of `with nogil(is_ok): status = my_func(ptr, x)` can be expressed in the following fashion:\r\n```python\r\n    if is_ok:\r\n        with nogil:\r\n            status = my_func(ptr, x)\r\n    else:\r\n        # hold the Gil\r\n        status = my_func(ptr, x)\r\n```\r\nso to me it's merely a shortcut of the above expansion.
