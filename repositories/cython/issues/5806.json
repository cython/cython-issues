Please describe.\n\nWe've got an (undocumented) compiler directive `optimize.inline_defnode_calls` which I think directly calls functions in closures without going through the python wrapper.\r\n\r\nIs there any value to having a similar option for global functions? We already have `error_on_unknown_names` which assumes no external monkey-patching so the assumption here would be similar.\r\n\r\nI suspect it should be off by default, but a lot of them mechanism is already there.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
