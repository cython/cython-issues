The first is that I can't load pickled Python objects as Cython extension types that have the same attributes without a lot of fiddling and extra code. Second, if I change the list of cdef attributes of an extension type, old pickled instances can't load anymore.\r\nWould it be possible for Cython to automatically define a `__setstate__` method that returns a dict, then for Cython to also define a `__getstate__` method that takes that dictionary, iterates through it, sets as many values as it can, and leaves the rest untouched?",
