In Pyhon enironment everything is fine and there is no problem and the improted package is working correctly. \r\n\r\nBUT when we call the package from anaconda jupyter notebook, or other anaconda edotors we encounter with the following problem:\r\n\r\nImportError: DLL load failed while importing code: The specified module could not be found.\r\n\r\nWould you guide me what if the problem and what should I do?\r\n\r\nI test it with the following simple code (Just wanna show you that there is no specific library or ...):\r\n\r\ndef mmntest():\r\n    print('this is a test')\r\n\r\nHow do I call pyd? I change the name of created pyd files to what are them originally and then inside init call them. (I'm emphasizing that it is working in python environment BUT only in anaconda enivronment I have above problem)",
