The `BaseSplitter` would use any subclass of `BaseCriterion` because it does not need access to the `init` function. However, if you use a `Splitter`, then the `Criterion` should be used. The code compiles and builds with Cython v0.29.33, but results in the error message shown.\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\nMy `_test.pxd` file:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class BaseCriterion:\r\n    \"\"\"Abstract interface for criterion.\"\"\"\r\n    cdef double A \r\n\r\ncdef class Criterion(BaseCriterion):\r\n    cdef int init(self) except -1\r\n\r\ncdef class BaseSplitter:\r\n    \"\"\"Abstract interface for splitter.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    # Internal structures\r\n    cdef public BaseCriterion criterion  # Impurity criterion\r\n    cdef public double max_features      # Number of features to test\r\n\r\ncdef class Splitter(BaseSplitter):\r\n    cdef const double[:, ::1] X\r\n\r\n    cdef int init(\r\n        self,\r\n        object X\r\n    ) except -1\r\n\r\n    # used to test the program in Python\r\n    cpdef int test(self, object X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand my `_test.pyx` file:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class BaseCriterion:\r\n    def __cinit__(self):\r\n        self.A = 0.\r\n\r\ncdef class Criterion(BaseCriterion):\r\n    cdef int init(self) except -1:\r\n        self.A = 1.\r\n\r\n\r\ncdef class BaseSplitter:\r\n    def __cinit__(self, BaseCriterion criterion, double max_features):\r\n        self.criterion = criterion\r\n        self.max_features = max_features\r\n\r\ncdef class Splitter(BaseSplitter):\r\n    cdef int init(\r\n        self,\r\n        object X\r\n    ) except -1:\r\n        self.X = X\r\n        self.criterion.init()\r\n        return 0\r\n\r\n    cpdef int test(self, object X):\r\n        return self.init(X)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nI would expect either a compilation error message, or for this to work as expected, since the Criterion class was used.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nOS: macOS 13.1 (22C65)\r\nPython version 3.9\r\nCython version 0.29.33\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nHappy to help submit PR(s) if that helps.",

So the issue is that I currently `BaseSplitter` would use only `BaseCriterion` methods and attributes, while `Splitter` would also have access to an additional `Criterion` attribute. However, because the attribute is defined as a `BaseCriterion`, it's looking for the method signature within that class rather than the `Criterion` class...\r\n\r\nThe options I can think of (that prolly don't work) are:\r\n1. overriding `cdef public BaseCriterion criterion` and redefining in the `Splitter` definition: I don't think this is allowed in Cython\r\n2. overriding the `init` function with different arguments in `BaseCriterion` and `Criterion`: I also don't think this is possible because method signatures must match exactly(?)\r\n3. re-designing how Splitter and BaseSplitter uses BaseCriterion/Criterion\r\n\r\nOn a related note, is there any roadmap for including the ability to do C++ templating in Cython after 3.0?",
