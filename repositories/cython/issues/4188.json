    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI have created a pdx file and imported it into my program so that I can use cdefs with structs since reading online that seemed to be the solution to cdef with structs as a type throwing 'is not a type identifier' but even after creating and cimporting the file it fails. This seems to be the canonical solution based off http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/sharing_declarations.html#the-cimport-statement\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nmain.py (reduced example):\r\n```cython\r\nimport raylib\r\ncimport raylib_structs\r\ncdef raylib_structs.Texture2D texture = LoadTexture(\"resources/textures/texture.png\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nraylib_structs.pdx:\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from \"raylib.h\":\r\n\tcdef struct Texture:\r\n\t\tunsigned int id        \r\n\r\n\tctypedef Texture Texture2D\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich results in (as well as if extern is removed):\r\n```cython\r\nmain.pyx:3:5: 'Texture2D' is not a type identifier\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCode compiles, texture variable is typed as raylib_structs.Texture2D or if using the original swig bindings without the pdx typed as raylib.Texture\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: XUbuntu 64-bit\r\n - Python version 3.8.6\r\n - Cython version 0.29.23\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI am using bindings generated by SWIG, using the types directly from the SWIG bindings created the initial error of 'is not a type identifier' as well.\r\n",
