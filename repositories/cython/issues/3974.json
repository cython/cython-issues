In my code, I would like to do [...]\r\n\r\nso I think the interface of having to setup setup.py can be made simpler, so perhaps a better way to do this could be, and then perhaps compile-and-cache on demand\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen, including code examples if applicable.\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython import cyimport\r\nmodule = cyimport(\"module-name.pyx\", __path__)\r\n\r\nmodule.somefunction(\"param1\", param2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n`cyimport` could also change to a better name, perhaps the more explicit `cython_import`\r\n\r\nadditionally\r\n`module  = cyimport(\"module-name\", __path__)`\r\n\r\nif no extension is provided it can be assumed to be a cython file\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI think one of the turn-offs of people when they read the documentation is the setup process, many people are not familiar with setup.py, and I think changing to a better interface can drive more people to using cython\r\n",
