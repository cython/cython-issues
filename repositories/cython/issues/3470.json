However, if I make the function take fused types \r\n```\r\ncdef numeric greater(numeric, numeric) nogil\r\n```\r\nthen neither `f = greater` nor `f = greater[double]` works in a nogil function.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering if there is a workaround for this (or probably a more correct way to write it)?",
