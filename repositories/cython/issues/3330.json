Felix is a C++ code generator which can currently generate Python 3 modules. So roughly, it can do the same thing as Cython, only with a quite different source language. I can't generate types yet, and there is no binding to the Python API.\r\n\r\nIn a bit more detail, if I write a file with some functions in it, Felix by default generates a shared library,  which can be run by a small thunk executable. If I export some of the functions as python, my compiler automatically builds a Python3 module table and initialisation routine, so the library can also be loaded by a Python interpreter, provided I can figure out how to get a properly built Python interpreter. This might either be embedded in Felix generated code, or, an actual Python executable, in the latter case the Python executable must link to the same shared library (this is not how Python is normally built on Linux but it seems to be how it is built on MacOS, I don't know about Windows yet).\r\n\r\nSo I'm both embedding Python AND generating extension modules. Or at least trying to :-)\r\n\r\nTo be useful though, the exported functions have to actually use the Python C API, which means I have to create a binding.  One possibility is to generate it by translating Cython's binding :-)\r\n\r\nAnother possible use of Cython is to generate tests, or possibly code I can bind to from Felix. \r\n\r\nI have experience with Python C API, I'm a compiler writer, and I know a bit about optimisation, and in the past I actually wrote a Python compiler. So I might well be able to contribute to Cython.\r\n",

I'm more interested in the sources, and how Cython works, and the potential for using it for integration purposes in various ways, and also possibly contributing to it. I also hate pip. Last few times I tried to use it, following various people's instructions, it didn't work. I'm a developer, I like to build things from source and hand install them sometimes so I can make modifications and track where what is being installed goes. This is particularly important on MacOS because it doesn't come with a package manager, and lots of horrible conflicts and issues arise with installations, and Apple often provides usable binaries but fails to provide the associated developer files (headers, etc). \r\n\r\nI do actually have a substantial Python program I'd like to convert to C, not for performance reasons, but to remove the dependencies on a Python install. We've had no end of hassles with library changes in Python versions, and I didn't write the code. Especially with unicode stuff on Windows and process management. Unfortunately I don't think Cython is up to processing it because it uses some @meta hacks to cache function operations (but I'm not sure). The product is fbuild, which is a build system. Felix uses it to build a bootstrap of itself, before using a second build system written in Felix.\r\n\r\nI'm looking at a lot of things at the moment. One of them is to use Python as the shell language for Felix. Instead of writing a shell, just use Python. More precisely, write the shell in Python using embedded Python interpreters. Better .. write the shell in Cython because that directly supports exactly what I need to do: add commands to the shell that were written in Felix. Felix generates C++ which is built into a shared library which happens to also be a CPython3 binary extension, so I can trivially load Felix code into any Python program if I provide an interface.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I have a number of possible things to explore which involve heavy duty automation of integration technology.  Hence .. I'm interested in Cython sources more than a binary. Apart from the build system I don't actually use Python much myself. But other people do. I'm particularly interested in NumPy customers.\r\n",

            "body": "> The point of this issue is that there is a bug in the Makefile, and a bug in the instructions on building the repository, both of which have trivial fixes: remove the dependency, and change the docs from make repo to just make all.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be more suitable to classify it as unclear documentation.  To quote the README:\r\n\r\n> Note that Cython used to ship the full version control repository in its **source distribution**, but no longer does so due to space constraints. To get the full source history, make sure you have git installed, then step into the base directory of the Cython source distribution and type:\r\n>\r\n>     make repo\r\n\r\nNote that `make all` actually do the making (sorry for the pun).\r\n\r\n> I also hate pip. Last few times I tried to use it, following various people's instructions, it didn't work. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry to hear so.  As an user, `pip` is absolutely heaven for GNU/Linux, but the experience on macOS might differs. Note that you can just execute the setup script directly if you don't want the immediate layer.\r\n\r\n> This is particularly important on MacOS because it doesn't come with a package manager, and lots of horrible conflicts and issues arise with installations, and Apple often provides usable binaries but fails to provide the associated developer files (headers, etc).\r\n\r\nFor this particular reason, when packaging your software, keep an eye on `pip`.  Building wheel with, say, `delocate` may prevent this inconvenience to your users.\r\n\r\nLooking at your current use case, I think it'd be best to just `path/to/your/python3 setup.py install --user`.  `make repo` simply turn a `sdist` into a git repo, while probably you tried to run it on a clone of the GitHub one already.",
