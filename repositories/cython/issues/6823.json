This manifests as a compilation error whenever a user does try to use the templated function e.g. `func[int]()`.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\nSee https://github.com/alexmalyshev/cython/commit/d9864c05fedccf49ec8c55aabfc11688f1814c81\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nCython selects the templated overload of `func` when it sees `func[T]()`.\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12\n\n### Cython version\n\nTrunk\n\n### Additional context\n\n~~This appears to work with 3.0.8, but not with 3.1-trunk.~~",
