There are various different ways how users configure their package build and their integration with Cython, which makes this change cumbersome. There should be one way to do it that helps both sides.\r\n\r\n**Options**\r\n- ?\r\n\r\n**Related tickets and changes**\r\n- https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/79637b23da77732e753b1e1ab5669b3e29978be3 (regenerate .c files when Cython version changes)\r\n- https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2531\r\n- https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1514\r\n- https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4405\r\n- https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4518",
