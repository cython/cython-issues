Arguably, the C compiler cannot optimise that away, so it *is* doing something at runtime, but that \"something\" is really, really cheap, especially when executed several times. If you can motivate that this consumes a non-negligible amount of time in your code, we may consider adding special cases for this, but I doubt that you'll find this being a bottleneck.",

Arguably, the C compiler cannot optimise that away, so it _is_ doing something at runtime, but that \"something\" is really, really cheap, especially when executed several times. If you can motivate that this consumes a non-negligible amount of time in your code, we may consider adding special cases for this, but I doubt that you'll find this being a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nI don't know how much a performance hit it is. It probably isn't much, but the code is very optimized and the function is called a lot. Plus, the perfectionist in me gets annoyed seeing a yellow line in a sea of white.\r\n\r\nForgive me since I don't know much about Cython's internal architecture, but if the problem is that the lhs could have side-effects, then why don't the non-empty arrays have the same issue? None of my lhs's have side effects, but only the one with the empty tuple causes the issue.\r\n",
