This is fine in that it will generate the correct result, but generates worse code than it needs to.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\nfor x in some_memoryview[::-1]:  # unoptimized\n    ...\nfor x in reversed(some_memoryview):  # good\n    ...\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Cython version\n\nmaster\n\n### Additional context\n\nSpotted while looking at #7259",
