Please describe.\r\n\r\nAs stated in title, I would like to erase some element in a STL container, say Multiset.\r\n```cython\r\ncdef multiset[int] my_multiset\r\n\r\nmy_multiset.insert(1)\r\nmy_multiset.insert(2)\r\nmy_multiset.insert(3)\r\nmy_multiset.insert(4)\r\n\r\ncdef multiset[int].reverse_iterator rit = my_multiset.rbegin()\r\n```\r\nTo erase an element the iterator pointing to, I need to use the erase interface which only supports forward iterator.\r\nIn cpp, one can easily get its base iter by `rit.base()`, but seems like `base` is not declared in the corresponding .pxd file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nMaybe declare the `base` interface for each STL container's reverse iterator?\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be great for Cython to support custom comparator for containers like multiset.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nTried converting types like `it = <multiset[int].iterator>(rit)`\r\nWon't work as expected, as reverse_iterator does not have such thing realized in cpp.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",
