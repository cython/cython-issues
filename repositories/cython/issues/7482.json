So I don't think it's because Python functions/macros aren't being inlined.\n* compiling with `CYTHON_USE_TYPE_SPECS=1` makes almost no difference so it isn't a heaptype/statictype difference.\n* compiling with `CYTHON_USE_TYPE_SLOTS=0` accounts for approximately half the difference. I tried a few things to avoid going through `PyType_GetSlot` (e.g.  just calling `PyObject_GenericAlloc` when the type is the expected type) but they didn't seem to make a huge difference.\n\nIt may well be that this is unavoidable - I certainly didn't find anything obvious to improve it. But it would be nice if it were quicker.\n\nCross-reference https://github.com/flintlib/python-flint/pull/349",
