    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI am struggling with setting the compiler directive `annotation_typing` to `False` successfully and by now it feels like a bug. Unfortunately the mailing list requires a Google account otherwise I would have asked there first.\r\n\r\nAs we introduced type hints recently but not perfectly we want to disable Cython's `annotation_typing` compiler directive. And since we have quite a few Python files, I would like to do so on a global level, not with a header line in each file.\r\n\r\nOur `setup()` call looked like this:\r\n\r\n    from distutils.core import setup\r\n    ...\r\n    from Cython.Distutils import build_ext, Extension\r\n    ...\r\n    setup(\r\n      name=\"foo\",\r\n      cmdclass={\"build_ext\": build_ext},\r\n      ext_modules=[list_of_Extension_objects],\r\n    )\r\n\r\nI have a type hint like `def foo(x: list)` and a call with `foo(tuple(...))` which leads to a `TypeError: Argument 'x' has incorrect type (expected list, got tuple` if I run the cythonized code (as it should, if we wanted this strictness).\r\n\r\nTo disable this I discovered the `annotation_typing` compiler directive on https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html . (While this is not documented in the docs of the stable version, the changelog suggests it does exist in 0.29.33 as well. I also did not encounter any errors about the directive being unknown during my tests.)\r\n\r\nBut everything I tried did not end up actually properly fixing the `TypeError` being raised:\r\n\r\na) Amending our `Extension` instantiations with it: `Extension(ext, [file_path], cython_directives={\"annotation_typing\": False})`\r\n\r\nb) Changing our `setup(..., ext_modules=...)` to `ext_modules=cythonize(list_of_Extension_objects, compiler_directives={\"annotation_typing\": False})`\r\n\r\nc) Setting it on the `Extension` objects *after* instantiation via `extension.cython_directives = {\"annotation_typing\": False}`\r\n\r\nd) Combinations of the above. Also tried with conflicting True and False settings to see if I could trigger any warning about a mismatch -> Nothing.\r\n\r\ne) It probably didn't do anything at all but I got desperate and even tried this... :} ->\r\n```\r\nfrom Cython.Compiler import Options\r\nOptions._directive_defaults[\"annotation_typing\"] = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nNone of these made the `TypeError` disappear. I did delete the target directory, the build directory each time and also used `setup.py build_ext --force ...`.\r\n\r\nDisabling the feature _does_ work if I add a `# cython: annotation_typing=False` header to the Python file(s) but we would really like to avoid this.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\nSee variations above.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNo `TypeError` when having conflicts between type hint and passed objects.\n\n### Environment\n\nOS: Ubuntu 22.04\r\nPython version 3.9.5\r\nCython version 0.29.33\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe exception is apparently not raised if using `3.0.0a11` so I could not test if the directive setting got applied in that version.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am really sorry if this is not a bug. ❤️ I did sent it to cython-users@googlegroups.com but the mail got rejected as I am not registered with a Google account there.",
