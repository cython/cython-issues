But we still accept `exception Exception, target`\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n# cython: language_level=3\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    pass\r\nexcept RuntimeError, a:\r\n    print(a)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nSyntaxError! (but continue to accept it with language_level=2)\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Cython version\n\nMost recent master\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt's probably too late to change this for Cython 3 (I suspect it might break a surprisingly large amount of existing code). It's possible we might chose to keep this as is forever, but I wanted to flag it.",
