Things like:\r\n* Current limitations and planned limitations (e.g. profiling, memoryviews pre 3.11, etc)\r\n* How to build it?\r\n* Do we need workarounds for setuptools and getting the correct compatibility tag on the .so file?\r\n* Anything else?\r\n\r\nIt's probably worth having a separate page on the topic.\r\n\r\nWhen we do it, we need to it clear which versions of Cython this documentation refers to.",
