Is there a way for it to not be ignored? Unfortunately `__dealloc__` is only valid as a` def` function, and it doesn’t accept `except +`.\r\n\r\nEven if I move the class to C++ and declare it with `cdef cppclass`, it’s still not possible to propagate exceptions from its destructor, since there seems to be no way to declare destructors on `cdef cppclass` declarations.",

            "body": "As a general rule you shouldn't be raising exceptions from destructors (either from C++ or Python). The basic problem is that destructors are often called while handling other exceptions and you can't have two exceptions at once.\r\n\r\nIt isn't completely clear [from the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc) what the rules are for exceptions in `tp_dealloc`. `tp_finalize` (which we don't yet support) definitely requires the exception state to be restored on exit.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not really convinced this is a bug. Swallowing the exception is definitely a sensible implementation choice (and probably the most sensible one)\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/extending/newtypes.html#finalization-and-de-allocation:\r\n\r\n> One important requirement of the deallocator function is that it leaves any pending exceptions alone. This is important since deallocators are frequently called as the interpreter unwinds the Python stack; when the stack is unwound due to an exception (rather than normal returns), nothing is done to protect the deallocators from seeing that an exception has already been set. Any actions which a deallocator performs which may cause additional Python code to be executed may detect that an exception has been set. This can lead to misleading errors from the interpreter. The proper way to protect against this is to save a pending exception before performing the unsafe action, and restoring it when done. This can be done using the PyErr_Fetch() and PyErr_Restore() functions\r\n\r\nThat, to me, suggests you pretty much have to clear the exception state in the destructor.",
