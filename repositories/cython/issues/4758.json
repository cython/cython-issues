Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe Numpy C API defines a way to generate [\"ufuncs\" from a C function pointer](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/c-api/ufunc.html). The C API takes a C callable and converts it into a Python callable that works on arrays of varying dimensions (broadcasting), and also handles reductions and broadcasting I think.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThe Numpy C API for this is accessible in Cython (via the pxd files) but is not hugely intuitive. It is also based around `void*`s to access the data, rather than the nicer Cython types like typed memoryviews). Therefore it might be nice to have a decorator to convert Cython cdef functions into Numpy ufuncs to allow them to work well with array broadcasting (people sometimes try to solve this problem with fused types of `double[:]`, `double[:,:]`, double[:,:,:]` etc., which is OK, but a bit ugly).\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncimport cython\r\n\r\n@cython.numpy_ufunc\r\ncdef double add(double x, double y):\r\n    return x+y  # obviously a trivial example which is in Numpy already\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNumba provides a similar feature https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/vectorize.html, so there's precedent (and people would probably understand it)\r\n\r\nThe Numpy C API also provides \"generalised ufuncs\". These would also be nice, but probably not part of an initial implementation.\r\n\r\nThis'd introduce a runtime+compile-time dependency on Numpy. Cython typically tries to be fairly dependency-free by default. I've proposed the decorator name `numpy_ufunc` to try to make that dependency as clear as possible. There's also a question: is there a way to do this without tying it to Numpy.\r\n\r\nIn the more distant future this might be a good place to introduce other backends (e.g. gpu, parallelization?). But definitely not for the initial version.\r\n\r\nI have no immediate plans to implement this for the moment - posted mainly to get a bit of feedback about whether it's likely to be useful",
