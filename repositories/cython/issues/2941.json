    "body": "I find that assigning a single value to all elements of a multidimensional memory view slice fails, unless the slice is taken along the first dimension. Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ndef bug():\r\n    cdef int[:, ::1] a\r\n    a = 2*np.ones((2, 2), dtype=np.intc)\r\n    a[:, :1] = 1\r\n    print(np.asarray(a))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiled and run, this prints the array `[[1, 1], [2, 2]]`, though it should print `[[1, 2], [1, 2]]`. The correct behavior is seen if we remove the `cdef` statement.\r\n\r\nThe same error is seen for memory views of larger dimension. Assignment to slices of all but the first dimension fails in this way. If I leave out the contiguousity on the declaration (i.e. use `int[:, :]`) it works.\r\n\r\nSurely this must be a rather critical bug? I couldn't find quite this usage [documented](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html#quickstart), as here either all or just a single element is assigned to. If you are not supposed to do arbitrary slice assignments with memory views, I would think that the cythonization should error out or at least emit a warning.\r\n\r\nTested on Python 3.7.3 with Cython 0.29.7, Python 3.7.1 with Cython 0.29.2, Python 3.5.2 with Cython 0.23.4 and Python 2.7.12 with Cython 0.23.4, all on Linux Mint 18.3 and using gcc 5.4.0.",
