    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nHello again. Sorry I didn't notice this before and file it along with #6855, but on trying 3.1.1, I came across another issue. Functions with a fused parameter type have their `__module__` attribute set to a name like `'_cython_3_1_1'` (obviously depending on the Cython version), rather than the name of module that they're part of.\n\nOnce again, this was working in 3.0.11, and functions with precisely specified parameters are not affected.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\nfrom cython cimport floating  # Fused float, double\n\ndef f1(double arg1):\n    return arg1 * arg1\n\ndef f2(floating arg1):\n    return arg1 * arg1\n```\n\n```python\nimport sample\n\nprint(sample.f1.__module__)  # e.g. 'sample'\nprint(sample.f2.__module__)  # '_cython_3_1_1'\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe `__module__` attribute should contain the module name, like for other functions.\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.1\n\n### Additional context\n\nI bisected it to commit fe8d895a771df9ecd16a58cbc796a56938e7cdf1 in PR #6634. I don't really understand what that's doing, though.",
