That should be a cheap check compared to re-acquiring the GIL.\n\nWe could easily do that by default for internal Cython-defined cdef functions. For `cdef extern from` functions we wouldn't be able to do that.  For `cimport`ed functions we couldn't do that immediately (because they might come from older Cython versions) but eventually we'd be able to assume that.\n\nMy feeling is that this would probably want a new exception specification to indicate it rather than trying to bolt this onto `except *`, but both would work.",

That provides a way of avoiding the problem with knowing what external modules do - they'd just leave it untouched in the \"maybe\" state and keep working as they do now.",
