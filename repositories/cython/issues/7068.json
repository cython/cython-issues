That should be a cheap check compared to re-acquiring the GIL.\n\nWe could easily do that by default for internal Cython-defined cdef functions. For `cdef extern from` functions we wouldn't be able to do that.  For `cimport`ed functions we couldn't do that immediately (because they might come from older Cython versions) but eventually we'd be able to assume that.\n\nMy feeling is that this would probably want a new exception specification to indicate it rather than trying to bolt this onto `except *`, but both would work.",
