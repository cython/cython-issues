Please describe.\n\n# Motivation\n\nI have been working on sorting algorithms for a bit.\nAnd while there are interesting sorting algorithms to implement and test in Python, it is literally impossible to produce anything that is remotely close in performance to `list.sort`.\n(I mean, are there any 3rd party sorting libraries that are actually being used?)\n\nSo ok, one of the reasons is that `list.sort` is generally hard to beat theoretically.\nHowever, it is still possible to implement something that has advantages in certain cases.\n\nAt least theoretically.\n\nHowever, in practice, optimisation comes down to two things:\n1. `list` access (Cython has it covered well)\n2. comparisons - this is the nasty bit\n\nSo `list.sort` has optimized comparisons for several types: `float`, `int`, `tuple`.\nAnd these are pretty much the main types in practice.\nThus, any implementation that doesn't have these comparisons optimised will never make it to production.\n\nAnd this applies to any comparison heavy algorithm - `heapq`, `bisect`, etc...\n\n---\n\nSo first I tried to special case for single algorithm.\nThen I realised that I need this for many more applications and started thinking about more general solution.\nBut it is quite a lot of effort to do so. Either:\na) I need to copy it over to every module that I need - results in a lot of code replication\nb) I need to make my modules interdependent.\n\n(b) is achievable and I will go for it if there is no other choice.\nHowever, linking modules at cython level solely to add comparison optimizations is not something that I am very excited about.\nCurrently all of them are nicely independent and I enjoy flat and clean structure.\n\nSo I thought maybe this could be of benefit as more general solution at Cython level.\n\n---\n\n<details><summary>Setup</summary>\n<p>\n\n```python\ndef test_cmp_py(arr: list):\n    v0 = arr[0]\n    i: cy_pst = 0\n    n: cy_pst = len(arr)\n    while i < n:\n        v0 < arr[i]\n        i += 1\n    return i\n\n\ndef test_cmp_c(arr: list):\n    v0 = arr[0]\n    i: cy_pst = 0\n    n: cy_pst = len(arr)\n    while i < n:\n        PyObject_RichCompareBool(v0, arr[i], Py_LT)\n        i += 1\n    return i\n\n\n@cy.ccall\n@cy.returns(cy_int)\ndef _is_lower(a: object, b: object):\n    tpa = type(a)\n    tpb = type(b)\n    if tpa is tpb:\n        if tpa is float:\n            af: float = a\n            bf: float = b\n            return af < bf\n\n        if tpa is int:\n            try:\n                ai: cy_pst = a\n                bi: cy_pst = b\n            except:\n                pass\n            else:\n                return ai < bi\n\n        if tpa is tuple:\n            if a:\n                if b:\n                    at: tuple = a\n                    bt: tuple = b\n                    a_ = a[0]\n                    b_ = b[0]\n                    res: cy_int = _is_lower(a_, b_)\n                    if res:\n                        return 1\n                    else:\n                        return at < bt\n                else:\n                    return False\n            elif b:\n                return True\n            else:\n                return False\n\n    return a < b\n\ndef test_cmp_cy(arr: list):\n    v0 = arr[0]\n    i: cy_pst = 0\n    n: cy_pst = len(arr)\n    while i < n:\n        _is_lower(v0, arr[i])\n        i += 1\n    return i\n```\n\n</p>\n</details> \n\n\n```python\n# NOTE: Loop itself   - 100 ns\n#       list access   - 0.5 ms\n#       cfunc,type,is - <50µs\n#       total subtract        - ~0.6ms\n\n# floats - most straight forward to do optimally\na = list(map(float, range(100_000)))\n                                  # Py   | Cython\n%timeit this.test_cmp_py(a)       #  6.5 | 1.2 -> 0.6 ms\n%timeit this.test_cmp_c(a)        #        1.4 -> 0.8 ms\n%timeit this.test_cmp_cy(a)       #        0.8 -> 0.2 ms\n\n# int - try-except overhead.

Either via macro or inline function.\n2. `list.sort` in `listobject.c` provides a good starting point for types above.\n3. Could either be default or opt-in via directive\n\nWould such optimization be useful to wider user base?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

If we speed up common cases by using type specific code, we degrade the performance of other types a little.\n\nThis is true, thus why I thought maybe making it opt-in via directive.\n\nHowever, that seems unnecessary complexity.\n\nAnd it might not be an issue.\n\nHopefully, if this can cover common cases, such as `float` and `int`, the rest to the large part are much more expensive so that in comparison such overhead is in the order of noise.\n\n\n> For the specific case of float, I tend to agree that's it's so trivial (in CPython) that it might just be worth inlining in general.\n\nYeah, `float` is easy. If `int` could be done as well, I think that would cover a very large number of use cases. It is slightly more difficult, but still seems to be reasonable simple with a pair of functions that you seem to have defined and making use of:\n\n```C\n    #define __Pyx_PyLong_IsCompact(x) ...\n    #define __Pyx_PyLong_CompactValue(x) ...\n```\n\nI checked:\n```py\n            pa = cy.cast(cy.pointer(PyLongObject), a)\n            pb = cy.cast(cy.pointer(PyLongObject), b)\n            if _PyLong_IsCompact(pa) and _PyLong_IsCompact(pb):\n                ai: cy_pst = _PyLong_CompactValue(pa)\n                bi: cy_pst = _PyLong_CompactValue(pb)\n                return ai < bi\n            else:\n                return a < b\n```\n\nAnd performance is the same as of float!\n```py\n        a = list(range(100_000))\n        %timeit this.test_cmp_py(a)       #  6.5 | 1.2 -> 0.6 ms\n        %timeit this.test_cmp_c(a)        #        1.3 -> 0.7 ms\n        %timeit this.test_cmp_cy(a)       #        0.8 -> 0.2 ms\n```\n\n---\n\nSomething for `tuple` would be a cherry on top.\n`list.sort` has it implemented.\nIf Cython implemented this too, it would mean that it has optimized comparisons to the degree that CPython's most optimized algorithm (in this sense) does.\n\n---\n\nWhich would be nice, but how useful would that be in general, I don't know.\nTo me - a lot, but I understand if this isn't the case for majority.\n\n",

Calls `PyObject_RichCompare` -> `PyLongObject`\n3. `PyNumber_InPlaceAdd`\n4.
