    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nAnything that needs to decode Python dicts in cygdb fails. The easiest way to notice this is `cy globals` but it shows up in lots of other places as well.\r\n\r\n(PS. I looked for related issues but didn't find anything. But 3.11 has been out for a while... Am I really the first person to run into this issue?)\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```\r\nBreakpoint 1, 0x00007ffff7813da6 in __pyx_pf_4tbbt_test (__pyx_self=<_cython_3_0_11.cython_function_or_method at remote 0x7ffff7c029b0>) at tbbt.c:2263\r\n2263      __pyx_t_1 = __Pyx_PyObject_Call(__pyx_builtin_print, __pyx_tuple_, NULL); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_1)) __PYX_ERR(0, 2, __pyx_L1_error)\r\n(gdb) cy globals\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/prakhar/mypyenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libpython.py\", line 1980, in wrapper\r\n    return function(*args, **kwargs)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/prakhar/mypyenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libcython.py\", line 108, in wrapper\r\n    function(self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/prakhar/mypyenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libcython.py\", line 1196, in invoke\r\n    global_python_dict = self.get_cython_globals_dict()\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/prakhar/mypyenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libcython.py\", line 383, in get_cython_globals_dict\r\n    for k, v in pyobject_dict.iteritems():\r\n  File \"/home/prakhar/mypyenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libpython.py\", line 687, in iteritems\r\n    entries, nentries = self._get_entries(keys)\r\n                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/prakhar/mypyenv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/Cython/Debugger/libpython.py\", line 731, in _get_entries\r\n    dk_size = int(keys['dk_size'])\r\n                  ~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^\r\ngdb.error: There is no member named dk_size.\r\nPython Exception <class 'gdb.error'>: There is no member named dk_size.\r\nError occurred in Python: There is no member named dk_size.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(the breakpoint doesn't matter... Any call that requires translating a Python dict will fail.)\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI expect it to not fail :).\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11+\n\n### Cython version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI did a little digging on this. The relevant header file is [pycore_dict.h](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Include/internal/pycore_dict.h).\r\n\r\nThe field `dk_size` was changed to `dk_log2_size`. This is actually a bit annoying because two other things changed:\r\n* They changed the limits for the size so that they fit into signed ints. The docs in that include file are actually incorrect. The correct docs are in [dictobject.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/dictobject.c#L39-L42).\r\n* There are now two different entry formats (there's a specialized format for string-only dicts).\r\n\r\nLuckily both of these changes are relatively simple to handle. The relevant function is [PyDictObjectPtr._get_entries](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Debugger/libpython.py#L714). Something like the following works for me:\r\n```\r\ndk_ix_size = 1 << int(keys['dk_log2_index_bytes'])\r\nent_addr = keys['dk_indices'].address\r\nent_addr = ent_addr.cast(_type_unsigned_char_ptr()) + dk_ix_size\r\nif int(keys['dk_kind']) == 0:\r\n    ent_ptr_t = gdb.lookup_type('PyDictKeyEntry').pointer()\r\nelse:\r\n    ent_ptr_t = gdb.lookup_type('PyDictUnicodeEntry').pointer()\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I'd submit a PR but my workplace is paranoid about IP and contributing to open-source projects. I know, it's dumb... Sorry!)",
