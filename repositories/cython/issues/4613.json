Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release?

Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI would like to be able to install custom exception handlers in my code to automate the translation of additional C++ exceptions into Python exceptions, similar to the automatic translation described [here](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/wrapping_CPlusPlus.html#exceptions) and implemented [here](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/db19667d81066aa20cf13ab3ea9cba8d5ab9c948/Cython/Utility/CppSupport.cpp#L9). It appears that such a handler is already possible to implement according to [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10684983/handling-custom-c-exceptions-in-cython). However, I don't find this behavior documented anywhere.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be helpful to add an example to the documentation showing how such a handler could be installed. I am happy to contribute it, but I don't know enough to know if the approach recommended in the post linked above is a good one or if it would need to be changed. I can certainly do it with some pointers.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI stumbled upon this while investigating whether it would be possible to add a Cython feature to directly modify the existing exception handler by defining a mapping between custom Python and C++ exceptions in a Cython file. While that seemed like an interesting idea, if it is already possible to accomplish this with a little C++ boilerplate as shown above I don't think there's much reason to add that complexity to Cython.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone.",

I don't think a custom handler would look much different.\r\n\r\nI agree that it would be good to add at least an example to the docs, and maybe also link to `__Pyx_CppExn2PyErr()`. The SO posts pretty much fill in all the details.\r\n\r\nOTOH, if you want to share the handler across modules, then it might be worth implementing it in a `.pxd` file as [verbatim C++ code](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/external_C_code.html#including-verbatim-c-code). It should usually be a simple function, so this shouldn't feel excessive, but would leave the code easily visible from your Cython code editor.\r\n\r\nPR welcome.",

I think this would fit well in [the exceptions section of the C++ docs](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/wrapping_CPlusPlus.html#exceptions), which already shows the possibility of a custom `raise_py_error`. The goal of my example is to show exactly what `raise_py_error` would look like, particularly if you wanted to define a mapping between any currently unhandled C++ exception and a (possibly user-defined) Python exception. Any thoughts on how best to adapt my gist into the docs? Also two questions about the contents:\r\n1. Do you think including my entire example is too verbose, and if so what could I strip out? Maybe not including all of the possible exceptions that Cython handles, and showing a handler that just handles one specific exception and raises a `RuntimeError` for everything else?\r\n2. Is my approach for creating a new Python exception the best way to handle this in Cython? I figured there was no need to add a separate `PyInit_*` function for a new module if I could just call the C function inside the Cython module.",
