    "body": "### Describe your issue\n\n[DLPack](https://dmlc.github.io/dlpack/latest/) is a C-ABI compatible data structure that allows data (tensor) exchange between frameworks. It has been adopted by packages such as Numpy, PyTorch and JAX. It shares some similar goals to the Buffer Protocol in Python.\n\nCython has added support to make it [easier](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html) to interact with the Buffer Protocol in the past.\n\nIs there any way for Cython to achieve something similar for objects that support DLPack i.e. make it easy to share the underlying array in a zero-copy way?\n\nAs some relevant context: DLPack supports a number of data types that are relevant to machine-learning/deep-learning (e.g. bfloat16) and which are not currently supported by the Buffer Protocol. There has been some [discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/buffer-protocol-and-arbitrary-data-types/26256) around extending the Buffer Protocol recently. DLPack is potentially another route. Given the importance of Cython in the scientific computing ecosystem (and beyond) I wanted to know how realistic it is to consider DLPack as an alternative.\n\nThanks!",
