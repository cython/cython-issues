    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\n`__pyx_capi__` stores a bunch of function pointers in the `void*` field of `PyCapsule`. Standard C forbids casting a function pointer to a void pointer (although Posix requires it to work). To work around this Cython uses a union type-punning mechanism:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/617a9592726e5d779a1de2973c83f510e0d4c7d6/Cython/Utility/ImportExport.c#L579-L583\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't really solve the problem: on some platforms (ia64 is a notable example I think) function pointers and regular pointers are different sizes, so the current method may lose information.\r\n\r\n~I think this also affect memoryviews which also create capsules of function pointers.~ Edit: they aren't used for anything any more\r\n\r\nI have a proposed fairly simple workaround in mind. I don't know how much we care, given there have been no real complaints about this.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI was looking at this in the context of pickling CyFunctions (which also needs to stash a function pointer in a Python object at some point).\r\n\r\nNumpy also looks to store function pointers in void pointers (in their import_array mechanism), looks to have had some support for ia64 at some point, and I can't find any bug reports about it. So I don't know if it's a real issue - I don't have a good way of testing it.",
