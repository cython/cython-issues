It seems the file in `Includes/numpy/__init__.pxd` is seen before mine when I try `cimport numpy`.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce: copy the `__init__.pxd` from `Includes/numpy` into `site-packages/numpy`, and add garbage in the original file so using it will crash cython (I used `xxxx = xxxxxxxxx`). Then build a project that calls `cimport numpy` such as pandas. If the copy is found, `cythonize` will succeed. If the original version is found, cythonize will crash.\r\n\r\nI am willing to work on a PR, but need some direction as to where to look for the problem.",

IMO if `sys_path` is True the precedence should be \r\n- user provided `include_directories`\r\n- `sys.path`\r\n- `Includes`\r\n\r\ninstead of the current situation which gives precedence to `Includes`",
