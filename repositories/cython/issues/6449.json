Cython would still include both header files if people cimport from the pxd, so it doesn't help much in terms of removing NumPy dependencies, but it would at least make it clear that users are probably better off with `libc.math` directly.\r\n\r\nI'd then also add a clear C warning, as @jakirkham suggested in https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/5967.
