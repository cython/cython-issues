This could also be used in regular Cython builds to allow inheritance from variable-sized types (e.g. `str`, `tuple`, `type`...).\n\nI haven't yet given it a lot of thought about how to do this. I don't think we want to apply it universally because it has a performance cost by adding indirection to cdef attribute lookup. A couple of obvious options:\n\n* Make it an opt-in decorator on a `cdef class`\n* Apply it automatically to all builtins in the Limited API, and to a known list of variable-sized builtins at other times.\n\nPersonally I'd prefer an opt-in decorator - anything else just seems a bit opaque and magic to me.  It also means that people can inherit from extern classes that we don't yet know about.",
