    "body": "Hello Cython Team,\r\n\r\nI am writing to propose a modification in the `prange` function's handling of the `num_threads` parameter. Currently, `prange` uses `None` as the default value for `num_threads` to indicate the usage of all available cores. While this approach works, it introduces a Python type (`NoneType`) into what is otherwise an integer parameter field. This mix of types could potentially lead to confusion and type inconsistency issues, particularly in strongly typed contexts or when interfacing with other languages.\r\n\r\nI suggest changing this default value to `-1`, a common convention in numerous libraries and frameworks to indicate \"all\" or \"automatic\" choices (e.g., scikit-learn, NumPy). This change would ensure that `num_threads` remains strictly an integer type, enhancing type safety and consistency in the API.\r\n\r\nHere are the key benefits of this proposed change:\r\n\r\n1. **Type Consistency**: Ensuring `num_threads` is always an integer simplifies type handling and reduces the risk of type-related errors.\r\n2. **Alignment with Established Practices**: Using `-1` as a default for such cases is a well-established pattern in the programming community, making it more intuitive for new users.\r\n3. **Simplified Interfacing**: When interfacing Cython with other languages or systems where type strictness is important, having a consistent type for all values of `num_threads` can simplify integration and reduce errors.\r\n\r\nI understand that this change would require a shift in the current API and might need a deprecation period for the current default value (`None`). I believe, however, that the long-term benefits in terms of API clarity and consistency would be significant.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSebastian",

            "body": "The bit I'm reluctant about:\r\n\r\nCurrently it doesn't look like it's valid to pass `-1` to OpenMP so your idea would work. However, if OpenMP decides in future that `-1` should mean something then we're somewhat stuck.  The advantage of using the separate type `None` as a flag is that we know it'll never conflict with any useful parameter for OpenMP.\r\n\r\nI suspect practically it's OK and this won't happen, but it makes me slightly nervous.",
