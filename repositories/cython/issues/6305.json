    "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nCurrently, the advertised use of packaging Cython involves integrating it into `setuptools`, which at times has an odd reputation. Some people dislike `setup.py` and so on. Most of the packaging metadata (all of it, for pure-python projects) is possible to describe in declarative configs. However, Cython needs some Python code for such an integration.\r\n\r\n@da-woods I mentioned this briefly at EuroPython and wanted to file a proper issue on the topic.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI think, it might be reasonable to provide a thin wrapper around the `setuptools`' build backend, letting the end-users plug it as follows:\r\n```toml\r\n# pyproject.toml\r\n[build-system]\r\nrequires = [\r\n  \"Cython\",\r\n]\r\nbuild-backend = \"cython.api.build_backend\"\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nI implemented something along these lines with a number of hacks and monkey-patching in a few projects. Just want to come up with something reusable upstream. I feel like I'm in a position to offer some insight from both the end-user/maintainer (ansible-pylibssh, yarl, aiohttp) and packaging worlds (with my PyPA hat on).\n\n### Additional context\n\nHere's `setuptools`' docs on wrapping its PEP 517 / 660 interface:\r\n* https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html#dynamic-build-dependencies-and-other-build-meta-tweaks\r\n\r\nHere's what I came up with in terms of replacing a `setup.py` with an in-tree build backend that's mostly configurable through its own section in `pyproject.toml`:\r\n* https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/blob/6b13867/pyproject.toml#L1-L63\r\n* https://github.com/aio-libs/yarl/tree/6b13867/packaging#readme\r\n* https://yarl.aio-libs.org/en/latest/changes/#id1\r\n\r\nObviously, there are a number of hardcoded things, but I just wanted to demonstrate what it's possible to achieve having such an integration. Also, check out the configuration toggles exposed to `python -Im build` in the change log document. They facilitate building projects with coverage collection in mind.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to link a few things that come from the Hatch/Hatchling ecosystem:\r\n* https://pypi.org/project/hatch-cython/ — an extension for hatch\r\n* https://github.com/ofek/extensionlib — an attempt to extract C-extension helpers from setuptools into something reusable with a nice common API",

I'll need to do a bit more reading and have a proper look through your example. Packaging isn't something I understand hugely well so will take a little bit of reading.\r\n\r\nI'm sure we can get something simple in though.",
