Please describe.\n\nThere's a number of different complex types available: the types from the C and C++ standard library, but also ad-hoc types from elsewhere like `np.npy_cdouble`. MSVC+C also doesn't help by doing something incompatible on top of this. They're all basically the same, and have the same memory representation, but are practically incompatible and so it's difficult to mix them in Cython. Cython helps a bit with `CYTHON_CCOMPLEX` but this only allows you to pick one option.\r\n\r\nThis mix of types looks to be making things hard for people: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/19657\r\n\r\nIt'd potentially be useful to have a way of marking a type as a complex number type (e.g. `@cython.complex_alias(type, float)` or something like that).\r\n\r\nCython would know that a type marked as a complex alias can be converted from any other with just a memory copy, saving some pain when converting between them (hopefully).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nPotential outline described above.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis isn't really a full plan at this stage.",
