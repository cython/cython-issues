This generator code is put into the shared ABI module. Therefore, it seems to me like the shared ABI module generated by a Cython module where these these macros is defined will not be the same as one defined where they aren't defined.\r\n\r\nThey mostly look like they're for \"known type shortcuts\" so possibly it doesn't matter and the code will still work, but it struck me as a slightly dodgy on first look.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Cython version: current master branch\r\n\r\n",
