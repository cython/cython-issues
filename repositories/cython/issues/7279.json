    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nOriginally reported in pypy/pypy#5347, since `__PYX_LIMITED_API` is not set to `Py_LIMITED_API` when compiling for PyPy. \n\nPackages can compile using PyPy and `Py_LIMITED_API`. This will not (yet, or perhaps ever) produce an api3 wheel, but should the compilation fail? If this code to define `__PYX_LIMITED_API` was moved out of the `CYTHON_LIMITED_API` stanza and into the general code, it would I think allow a path forward for gradual adoption of the limited API in all cython compilation variants. https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/e2ef20c527c7d0b1b01d2cbb486c0db92d54d323/Cython/Utility/ModuleSetupCode.c#L200-L204\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\npypy3.11 -m pip install cython-test-exception-raiser --no-clean\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nAny\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.6\n\n### Additional context\n\nI am not sure how much effort to put into this, but if it is a quick fix that would be nice.",

The question is then how Cython should deal with the current situation.\n\n- It could actively prevent users from setting `Py_LIMITED_API`, thus preventing the code from compiling. That's pretty much what currently happens, although unintentionally.\n\n- It could ignore `Py_LIMITED_API` if it considers the platform incompatible, and use its own platform specific settings.\n\n- It could `#undef` it, possibly with a `#warning`, thus making sure that external includes also don't get in touch with the setting.\n\nAt the current state, it's a user error if `Py_LIMITED_API` is set on PyPy. We cannot fix that for existing code using an existing Cython version, but we can decide how to deal with it in generated code with future Cython versions.\n\nI'm uncomfortable with actively `#undef`-ing a user setting. That might lead to unexpected behaviour in its own right, depending on the place where it's unset. Even ignoring it seems questionable.",

(I'd feel differently if PyPy could handle ABI3 wheels though).\n\nI still think \"move the definition of `__PYX_LIMITED_VERSION_HEX`\" is still the right short-term thing that do that'll probably make some things work.
