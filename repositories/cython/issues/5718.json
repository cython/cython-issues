However, it's just as unstable as the C API so it loses some of the point of using the limited API since we have no real forwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nI'd propose to make the creation of code objects an allowed failure in the limited API only. They're mostly used for introspection and not providing core functionality so most people will probably be happier with a module that continues to work and a warning suggesting to recompile with up-to-date Cython.\r\n\r\n(It's probably worth treating this as a general principle - when we have to use unstable Python API in the limited API we should try to make it an allowed failure if possible)",
