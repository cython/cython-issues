Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to be able to have a few source .pyx files that are compiled into one shared library but they have the same name. For example, `test` is a package, and if `test.test` is a module inside `test` then compiling the `test/__init__.py` and `test/test.py` results in `PyInit_test` being defined twice. What could happen is a way to distinguish between two modules in the C code. (i don't understand what the generated C code is from cythonize but i do recognize that all `PyInit` functions only include the module name and not the full package path like `test.sub.mod1` etc)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nManually doing it (idk what im doing though)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm trying to bundle an entire package into a single .so file or .pyd file. It's working out a bit but if two modules have the same name I have a problem. See https://gist.github.com/rayzchen/ca0b4c87e90642a4cee0dda4b9405c86.\r\n",

            "body": "We pick the name of the `PyInit` functions to match what Python requires. There is no freedom to use a different name. The easiest (and probably only) solution would be to just rename your modules (you might be able to just set a name when you call `Extension` in setup.py).\r\n\r\nBuilding a single .so/.pyd file is not something that Cython supports directly. There's a few tools available that try to build multi-module files - e.g. https://github.com/smok-serwis/snakehouse/ and https://github.com/dave-msk/merak. You may want to use one of them, or to see if they have come up with a solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to ask on the cython-users mailing list and see if anyone has a better suggestion.\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue because I think it isn't something that we want to/can support in Cython at the moment.",
