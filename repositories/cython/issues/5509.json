Although Python itself will be responsible for the positioning of the struct within allocated memory, \r\n     it's pretty much got to be right, otherwise it'd break a lot of code (especially on platforms that require alignment)\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think this scheme is an unnecessary pessimization. I've tried putting in an assert to check the alignment and can't get it to trip locally (which doesn't prove it's right, but suggests it might be at least on some platforms).\r\n\r\nAm I missing anything?",
