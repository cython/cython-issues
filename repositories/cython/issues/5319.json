Please describe.\n\nIt's a fairly common [and documented](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html?highlight=staticmethod#instantiation-from-existing-c-c-pointers) pattern to use cdef `@staticmethod`s to construct a class from C types that cannot be converted to/from Python.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't stop users from constructing the type normally from within Python (which may put it in an invalid state). The example in the documentation kind of does this by raising a `TypeError` from `__init__`, but it's possible to get around it by calling `__new__` from Python. It also makes instantiating it from the `staticmethod` somewhat fiddly.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nIt'd be nice to have a decorator to say \"this type can only be constructed from Cython\". `@internal` kind of does that, but isn't quite the same and isn't really documented (`@internal` hides the class, but once you have access to an instance of it I think you can still construct it).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nThere's some fiddly decisions about inheritance, and what we allow/disallow in terms of `__cinit__`.",

            "body": "So the bottom line is: using `__init__` raises an error, but can you use `__new__` to bypass it and create a class anyway?\r\nCan this be prevented by raising an error in `__new__`?\r\nAnd if not, I think \"*We're all consenting adults here*\" and the idea is, Feel free to shoot yourself in the foot if you have to.\r\nHas it already happened and can it really exhibit bad behavior unintentionally?",
