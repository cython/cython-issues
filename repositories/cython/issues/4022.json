I remember a time (e.g. [here](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2800#issuecomment-466781420)) when 3.0 had been planned to be released in 2019, which is not in any way meant as a criticism - I get how ambitious this project is, and how constrained the resources.\r\n\r\nStill, version numbers are cheap (perhaps aside from the emotional attachment) - why not release 3.0 more or less as is, and push the blockers to 4.0? There are many improvements in the master branch that people are waiting for (or even blocked on). This would also finally open the door for removing py27, py34 & py35 support (for reference, even py36 is EOL in 3 month)...\r\n\r\nI ask mainly because the todo-list for 3.0 has not gotten substantially shorter in recent times, and there doesn't seem to be a plan-of-attack to tackle it (which is fine!). But perhaps perfect is the enemy of good here, and pushing out a new major version could relieve some pressure and rejuvinate spirits. ðŸ™ƒ ",

What remains with regard to incompatible changes is: #4280 #2304\r\n> \r\n> [The rest](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22P%3A+blocker%22) are mostly bugs, which by definition aren't release critical (enough to block the 3.0 release).\r\n\r\n@scoder, now that these two have been solved, what \"truly critical 3.0 issues\" are left, if any? I'm guessing #4936 might qualify (which has a pretty advanced [PR](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/5016), luckily), is there anything else IYO?",
