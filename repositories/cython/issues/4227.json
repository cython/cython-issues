Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Bug**\r\nI suspect that cython just skips annotations if they are not in a function or in a class, so as a result, the types of variables declared in this way are python objects.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\n# cython: annotation_typing=True\r\n\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\na: cython.int\r\nb: cython.int = 5\r\n\r\n# cython.typeof(a)  # CompileError - undeclared name not builtin: a\r\ncython.typeof(b)    # Python_object and no indication of it!\r\n```\r\nAn easy way to understand this is to use `annotate=True`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52697657/121831398-04292000-ccd0-11eb-93ed-5e28ac510368.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSame as if I compiled this:\r\n```cython\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\ncdef int a\r\ncdef int b = 5\r\n\r\ncython.typeof(a)  # int\r\ncython.typeof(b)  # int\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52697657/121831658-a6e19e80-ccd0-11eb-907f-701244a57429.png)\r\n\r\nThat is, so that both `a` and `b` are of type `int`, if for some reason this is not the correct behavior, then either an exception or a warning about it.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - OS: Microsoft Windows 10\r\n - Python version Python: 3.9.0\r\n - Checked Cython versions: 3.0a7, 0.29.23\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI also checked the rest of the options, here:\r\n```cython\r\n# cython: annotation_typing=True\r\n\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\n# same with pure python analogs,\r\n# e.g. @cython.cclass, @cython.cfunc or @cython.ccall\r\ncdef class Foo:\r\n    cdef int a  # cannot be initialized here\r\n    b: cython.int\r\n    c: cython.int = 4  # on 0.29: AssertionError: Python global or builtin not a Python object\r\n    cython.declare(d=cython.int)  # no initialization functionality in this case\r\n    e = cython.declare(cython.int)  # cannot be normaly initialized here (#4220)\r\n\r\n    # or cdef or cpdef; function body code is practically the same\r\n    def bar(self):\r\n        cython.typeof(self.a)  # int\r\n        cython.typeof(self.b)  # int\r\n        cython.typeof(self.c)  # Python_object but warned on compilation with 3.0a7\r\n        cython.typeof(self.d)  # int\r\n        cython.typeof(self.e)  # int\r\n\r\n\r\ncdef int a\r\ncdef int b = 5\r\nc: cython.int\r\nd: cython.int = 5\r\ncython.declare(e=cython.int)  # no initialization functionality in this case\r\nf = cython.declare(cython.int)\r\ng = cython.declare(cython.int, 5)\r\n\r\ncython.typeof(a)    # int\r\ncython.typeof(b)    # int\r\n# cython.typeof(c)  # CompileError - undeclared name not builtin: c\r\ncython.typeof(d)    # Python_object and no indication of it!\r\ncython.typeof(e)    # int\r\ncython.typeof(f)    # int\r\ncython.typeof(g)    # int\r\n\r\n\r\ndef baz():\r\n    cdef int a\r\n    cdef int b = 6\r\n    c: cython.int\r\n    d: cython.int = 6\r\n    cython.declare(e=cython.int)  # no initialization functionality in this case\r\n    f = cython.declare(cython.int)\r\n    g = cython.declare(cython.int, 6)\r\n\r\n    cython.typeof(a)  # int\r\n    cython.typeof(b)  # int\r\n    cython.typeof(c)  # int\r\n    cython.typeof(d)  # int\r\n    cython.typeof(e)  # int\r\n    cython.typeof(f)  # int\r\n    cython.typeof(g)  # int\r\n```\r\n",

If we wanted thorough testing, we'd have to run pretty much the entire test suite for the cross product of all directives. Or most of them anyway. That's far too many combinations to ever test completely, so we end up with bugs that people will still run into years from now. Any new directive add to that risk and reduces the overall test coverage of language functionality.",
