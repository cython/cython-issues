The error is:\n```\nbug.c: In function ‘__pyx_gb_3bug_2generator’:\nbug.c:2632:32: error: assignment to expression with array type\n 2632 |     __pyx_cur_scope->__pyx_t_1 = __pyx_t_2;\n      |                                ^\nbug.c:2643:15: error: assignment to expression with array type\n 2643 |     __pyx_t_2 = __pyx_cur_scope->__pyx_t_1;\n      |               ^\n```\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\ndef function():\n    cdef char* result = \"ABC\"\n\n    for ch in \"X\":\n        result[0] = ch\n        yield 0\n```\nBoth the loop and the yield appear to be necessary to trigger this.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12.3\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.2.1\n\n### Additional context\n\n`__pyx_t_2` holds the `\"X\"`. Cython 3.1.7 declares it the following way:\n```c\nunsigned char const *__pyx_t_2;\n```\nBut Cython 3.2 declares it as an array:\n```\nPy_UCS4 __pyx_t_2[1];\n```\nThe initialization changes from\n```c\n__pyx_t_2 = ((unsigned char const *)((char const *)\"X\")); // Cython 3.1.7\n```\nto\n```c\n__pyx_t_2[0] = 88; // Cython 3.2.1\n```\nBut the assignment (the one shown in the error message) did not change.\n\nI searched the issues and found the `assignment to expression with array type` error message only in #5178, which I believe is not related.\n\nReported to me at https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt/issues/864",

Instead of storing away the literal C array as a global constant or keeping it in the generator's closure, we can generate it in place before looking up the loop item in it, all inside of the loop body. That looks silly in the C code, but the tight usage scope and the visible literal array values allow the C compiler to pull all its tricks to make the loop efficient. And it minimises the amount of temporary variables that we need to store in the generator closure while yielding.\n\nI validated that the resulting assembly looks reasonable with gcc 13 for generators as well as for simple loops. I'll send a PR shortly.\n\nEDIT: as discussed in the PR, gcc does not actually take advantage of seeing the array content and generated fairly slow code as a result.",
