However, the compiler complains about not being able to convert between the two when again, they appear to be interchangeable.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that one of the following holds true:\r\n- `object` and `PyObject*` are equivalent and the Cython compiler has a bug where it does not consider `object` a shorthand for `PyObject*`.\r\n- `object` and `PyObject*` are not equivalent and the `Includes` directory has `.pxd` files with wrong specifications.",

There is no dedicated borrowed reference type in Cython, that's why we use the pointer type for it. Converting between a pointer (any pointer in fact, also `void*`) and an owned object reference is done through a cast, either `obj = <object>ptr` (which increases the refcount => owned reference) or `ptr = <PyObject*>obj` (which leaves the refcount allone => borrowed reference).\r\n\r\nPR welcome that puts that explanation into a reasonable place.",
