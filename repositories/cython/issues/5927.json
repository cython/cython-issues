However, it's based on struct sizes that are version dependent and have shrunk a little since we copied the test. So it's possible that the test is now testing something that's probably too big but might just is possible.\r\n\r\nIt's testing a CPython implementation detail that's tested properly as part of CPython. I don't think there's much value to Cython in having this test and I don't think it's worth you spend time debugging it.\r\n\r\nI'll make a PR to remove it shortly",
