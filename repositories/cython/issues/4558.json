Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nAllocating a class with const members on the stack produces a .cpp file that can't be compiled because an instance of the class would be assigned to a an optional.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n- myclass.h:  \r\n  ```cpp\r\n  class MyClass {\r\n  public:\r\n      const int a;\r\n      MyClass(int a) : a(a) {};\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n- my_module.pxd\r\n  ```pxd \r\n  cdef extern from \"myclass.h\":\r\n      cdef cppclass MyClass:\r\n          MyClass(int a) except +\r\n  ```\r\n- test.pyx\r\n     ```cython\r\n    # cython: language_level=3\r\n    # distutils: language = c++\r\n    # cython: cpp_locals=True\r\n    \r\n    from .my_module cimport MyClass\r\n    \r\n    cdef a_function():\r\n         cdef MyClass instance = MyClass(1);\r\n    ```\r\nCompile using:\r\n```\r\ncython test.pyx --cplus\r\ngcc -c test.cpp -I<python include directory> -std=c++17\r\n```\r\nError message:\r\n```\r\ntest.cpp: In function ‘PyObject* __pyx_f_7package_4test_a_function(int)’:\r\ntest.cpp:1849:26: error: use of deleted function ‘std::optional<MyClass>& std::optional<MyClass>::operator=(std::optional<MyClass>&&)’\r\n 1849 |     __pyx_t_1 = MyClass(1);\r\n      |                          ^\r\nIn file included from test.cpp:1185:\r\n/usr/include/c++/10/optional:659:11: note: ‘std::optional<MyClass>& std::optional<MyClass>::operator=(std::optional<MyClass>&&)’ is implicitly deleted because the default definition would be ill-formed:\r\n  659 |     class optional\r\n      |           ^~~~~~~~\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe code to be generated correctly. My naive approach would be to replace the assignment with `std::optional::emplace(...)`, but I'm not sure if this would break other things.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Debian 11\r\n - Python version: 3.9.7\r\n - Cython version: 3.0.0a10\r\n",

The move constructor throwing is probably less likely though.\r\n\r\nThere's a general issue here:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef some_cppclass a = some_cppclass(1)\r\ntry:\r\n    A = some_cppclass(2)\r\nexcept pass:\r\n    pass\r\n# Cython assumes that A is definitely set, and safe to use without checks here, but actually it isn't true, pretty much however you implement it.\r\n```",
