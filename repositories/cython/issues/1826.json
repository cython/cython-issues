    "body": "Hi,\r\nWe are using Cython in some parts of our projects. And we also use the type annotation feature of Python for our Python projects. To unblock type checking over the boundary between Python code and Cython code, we created pyi files for our Cython code so that the type checkers like mypy could find the names defined in the Cython code. We also created pyi files for cython.py and would like to contribute it back to the typeshed upstream. Are you guys good with us adding the stubs for Cython to typeshed? https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/1554",

            "body": "Thanks for doing that!\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand typeshed, they are just a repository for keeping third party stubs. I guess the reason why we would want to store those stubs externally, rather than shipping them with Cython, is that people who use your code uncompiled then wouldn't need to install Cython as a dependency just for the annotations. That would mostly solve the problem of packages trying to concurrently install a version of cython.py (a.k.a. Cython/Shadow.py) in order to use Cython type declarations in their Python code.\r\n\r\nOne drawback is that we'd have to reach out to typeshed in order to update the list of types (which tends to be rare and certainly hasn't happened in a while).\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure about the impact on issue #1672. It might actually just work ;) - would you have an example of actual code that uses these annotations? Are you writing your code in Python syntax to allow optional compilation with Cython?",

The tool is generating Python .pyi files from Cython sources. This enables type checking of code that uses .so files produced by Cython without mypy having to understand Cython syntax. This doesn't solve type checking of Cython files themselves, that will come later.\r\n\r\n@ambv Has this tool ever been released or is there nowadays still a chance this will ever be released?\r\n\r\n",
