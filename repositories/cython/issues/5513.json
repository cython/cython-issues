The use case that I have involved junyper notebook, when users sometime need high performing snippets, for which there is no numpy or /pandas or scypy solution.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nIdeally, use one of the on the fly c compilers to compile the code on the fly, load the generated object. I am trying to avoid the need to setup full compiler toolset (gcc, clang).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nThere are code generation library, which will work with AST to generate code, some of them can optimize for SIMD, etc. however, this is going beyond my Python skills. Is it possible to convert the Python AST directly to machine code ?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
