If it's intended it's not actually much of a burden to add explicit type casting to our code base (about 15 lines are affected).",

The consequences are that\r\n> - `a**b` of two ints may return a floating point type,\r\n> - `a**b` of one or more non-complex floating point numbers may return a complex number.\r\n\r\nCython cannot decide here, as `width` can be positive or negative, one returns a whole number while the other returns a floating type\r\n```python\r\n>>> 5**-3\r\n0.008\r\n>>> 5**3\r\n125\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can set `width` to `np.uint64_t` to help cython resolve this to a whole number type or revert to old behaviour:\r\n\r\n> The old behaviour can be restored by setting the cpow [compiler directive](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html#compiler-directives) to True.\r\n\r\nOr even better - `@cython.cpow(True)` decorator",
