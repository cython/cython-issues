I quite like having the whole table-of-contents available on one page like in [your first image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55311527/147910922-66d6ff81-215d-4ef2-8513-0f397edf68f4.png). I think scrolling is easier than clicking, and the whole table-of-contents isn't unreasonably big\r\n\r\nThanks, I will revert it back.\r\n\r\nI have questions in:\r\n\r\n- docs/src/reference/interfacing_with_other_code.rst\r\n- docs/src/reference/limitations.rst\r\n- docs/src/reference/special_mention.rst\r\n\r\ngive error in build, for not listed in `:toctree::` soo I add `:orphan:` in all of them because is the content is very old and just heading. is this correct?\r\n",
