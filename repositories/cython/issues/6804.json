    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nEssentially, If we have some C++ struct `IntContainer`, and it's used as a temporary to a method that takes `const T&`, for example `vec.push_back(IntContainer(...))`, we'll initialize `IntContainer` as a `const` with:\n\n```\nstruct IntContainer const __pyx_t_1;\n```\n\nBut, we would then run into this C++ error:\n\n```\nvector_const.cpp:2631:29: error: default initialization of an object of const type 'const struct IntContainer' without a user-provided default constructor\n 2631 |   struct IntContainer const __pyx_t_1;\n      |                             ^\n      |                                      {}\n```\n\nAnd we cannot assign to it later on:\n```\nvector_const.cpp:2645:20: error: cannot assign to variable '__pyx_t_1' with const-qualified type 'const struct IntContainer'\n 2645 |   __pyx_t_1.number = __pyx_v_number;\n      |   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^\n```\n\nThis only occurs if we create `IntContainer` in-line, but it's fixed if we pull it into a variable:\n\n```\ni = IntContainer(...)\nvec.push_back(i)\n```\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\nhttps://github.com/pilleye/cython/commit/8ab76a06915465d925489d5719e6f036aced2092 \n\n\n```cython\npython runtests.py -3 --backends cpp -vv vector_const --no-cleanup\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nBoth cases should be the same, both should not error.\n\n### OS\n\nMac\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12\n\n### Cython version\n\n`master`\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

            "body": "So in part the problem is that you've told Cython that `IntContainer` is a struct, when you're trying to use it as a C++ class. That leads to slightly different code-generation in Cython - `IntContainer(number)` doesn't try to call a constructor but instead default initializes and manually sets the attribute `number`.\n\nI know in C++ `struct` and `class` are basically interchangeable and just affect the default visibility. However Cython treats them pretty differently, and in this case you're trying to use it as a \"class\".\n\nSo doing\n\n```\ncppclass IntContainer:\n        int number\n        IntContainer(int)\n        IntContainer()\n```\n\nworks fine.\n\n------------------------------\n\nWith that said, I think there are still code generation issues here.",
