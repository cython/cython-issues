    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently one can write in Cython an `enum` using `cpdef`, which exposes it to Cython and Python. However there doesn't appear to be a way to do this in pure Python (aside from declaring the `enum` in a `.pxd` file alongside the `.py` file). It would be useful to have some kind of syntax to declare an `enum` in pure Python, which provides an efficient C implementation around it. Though must admit am a bit clueless on what this would need to look like.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nGiven the current use of decorators for other Cython objects in pure Python (like `cclass` and `cfunc`), one approach might be to use a decorator here like so.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython import cenum\r\n\r\n@cenum\r\nclass Status:\r\n    stopped: \"Py_ssize_t\" = 0\r\n    running: \"Py_ssize_t\" = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nThough another option might be to use a base class for all Cython `enum`s. Not sure if this has any advantaged over the former.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython import CEnum\r\n\r\nclass Status(CEnum):\r\n    stopped: \"Py_ssize_t\" = 0\r\n    running: \"Py_ssize_t\" = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother potential option would be to follow the syntax Python itself uses and allow `cclass` (or perhaps still `cenum`) to handle this case (only using `Enum` as hint).\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython import cclass\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\n@cclass\r\nclass Status(Enum):\r\n    stopped: \"Py_ssize_t\" = 0\r\n    running: \"Py_ssize_t\" = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere might be other variants on this that I'm not aware of that would be better still.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNA\r\n",

Given that all the values in an enum must have the same type, it seems redundant (and possibly a problem if two types contradict each other)\r\n\r\nI'm possibly the wrong person to ask though.
