    "body": "I used to write hand-made C++ extension module to wrap our C++ libraries for Python. I would like to hide all the symbols (including the symbols from head-only C++ libraries and static libraries in the dependencies), except the `PyInit_XXX` which is the only symbol needed to be exported.\r\n\r\nIn Windows all the symbols are hidden by default. And the macro in `Python.h` add `dllexport` to the `PyInit_XXX` function. In Linux I use `-fvisibility=hidden` in Linux to hide all the symbols in the extension module and add `__attribute__((visibility (\"default\")))` the `PyInit_XXX` manually (with OS detection in macro).\r\n\r\nNow I try to write Python wrappers using Cython. I cannot compile with option `-fvisibility=hidden` anymore because the Cython generated C++ code does not export `PyInit_XXX` by `__attribute__((visibility (\"default\")))`. I have to hack the C++ code using string replace in the `setup.py` by inserting visibility setting into the macro definition.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that Cython takes this into account automatically (or via a code-gen argument like default hide all symbols)? I know that Cython generated C++ code label everything static except the `PyInit_XXX`. However, the symbols that the dependencies of the wrapper C++ library (like header only) are visible without setting default visibility to hidden.",
