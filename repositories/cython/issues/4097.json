When code quality improves, it will be easier for new people to join the development,\r\n\r\nFor example, we could use deepsource.io (There might be better choices. This is the first tool I tried, from Github market): \r\nhttps://deepsource.io/gh/Endle/cython/run/e06c2d6d-6e31-4688-8bd4-59f0a31748c6/python/\r\n\r\nThe analysis is executed in deepsource server, instead of travis ci or github action. Adding a static analysis won't delay current CI jobs.\r\n\r\nIt might be easier to integrate a github market app after [Migration to Github Action](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3913)\r\nHowever. I don't think Issue #3913 is a blocker to this proposal. We can start static analysis (see above) without touching current CI pipeline\r\n",

The output of your test run is full of those.\r\n\r\nNote that that service pretty much only runs pylint, pyflake, etc. These are best set up locally, for various reasons: being able to run them locally, being independent of specific service providers, allowing their use as a git commit-hook, etc.\r\n\r\nOur test runner in `runtests.py` already runs `pycodestyle` and adds the output to the test results. That's one way of doing it, certainly not the worst, athough there are other ways. If you want to start writing up configurations for pyflakes, pylint & friends, preferably starting from some reasonable base configuration, I'd be happy to get a PR for it.",
