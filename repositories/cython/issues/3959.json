However, this appears to be not possible, and we had to work around it by explicitly declaring a Python object referencing it:\r\n```python \r\n# test_cpdef_module_var.pyx\r\n\r\n...\r\ncpdef str _abc = 'this is abc'\r\nabc = _abc\r\n...\r\n```\r\nwhich is both counterintuitive and cumbersome. I tried searching in the issue tracker but it doesn't seem to be reported yet, and the closest report I found is this (https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/656) but not exactly the same, so I hope I am simply missing something obvious...\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Python version: 3.7.8\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.21\r\n",

Obviously for your `str` it is ultimately a Python object, but that's the general rule on why it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nIn more recent versions it might be possible to do using a module-level `__getattr__` but it definitely isn't implemented yet.\r\n\r\nCython should probably tell you that they don't work, so this bug is really a failure of error reporting.",
