Obviously for your `str` it is ultimately a Python object, but that's the general rule on why it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nInteresting, though I am more confused. I thought that module-level `cdef` variables can always be cimported, and that module-level Python objects can always be imported. For example, this works fine:\r\n```cython\r\n$ cat test_cython_cpdef1.pxd\r\ncdef str abc\r\n\r\n$ cat test_cython_cpdef1.pyx\r\ncdef str abc = 'xyz'\r\n\r\n$ cat test_cython_cpdef2.pyx\r\nfrom test_cython_cpdef1 cimport abc\r\n\r\ncpdef print_str():\r\n    print(abc)  # so calling test_cython_cpdef2.print_str() in Python will output \"xyz\"\r\n```\r\nSo what's special with `cpdef` variables? Can't a `cpdef` variable be split into two objects? One lives in C and the other stays in the module's dict as a Python object (like `abc` above in the line `abc = _abc`), and then refers to its C counterpart when accessed?\r\n\r\n> In more recent versions it might be possible to do using a module-level `__getattr__` but it definitely isn't implemented yet.\r\n\r\nBy recent version do you mean Python 3.9+? \r\n\r\n> Cython should probably tell you that they don't work, so this bug is really a failure of error reporting.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose there're two failures for this bug:\r\n1. Poor error reporting for older versions (of whatever you referred to)\r\n2. Missing implementation for handling it properly in newer versions (of whatever)\r\n\r\nAm I right?",

Module-level variables defined in the normal Python way (`abc = \"something\"`, no `cdef`) can always be imported, and are Python objects.\r\n3.
