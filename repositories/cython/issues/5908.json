This means that a subclass of the `Dict` type cannot be passed to the function.\r\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\n❯ cat example.pyx\r\nfrom typing import Dict\r\n\r\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\r\n\r\ncdef f(p: Dict):\r\n    print(\"foo\")\r\n\r\nd = OrderedDict()\r\n\r\nf(d)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNo error.\n\n### OS\n\nmacOS, Linux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.10.13\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.6\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
