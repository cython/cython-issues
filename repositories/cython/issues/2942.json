Obviously, the context manager returned by `open()` does not (currently) do that, but others might. If the `f.readlines()` above fails, and the context manager decides to ignore the exception, then `contents` would not be initialised, and the following `print()` would raise an `UnboundLocalError`.\r\n\r\nWhile we could special-case `open` in Cython, I'd rather not, because then you would still get the warning in cases where Cython does not (or cannot) know the behaviour of the context manager, which would be even more confusing.",
