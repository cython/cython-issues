The master contains numerous algorithms, e.g. [transform](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Includes/libcpp/algorithm.pxd#L89-L100), etc. which are not present in the current latest version. I checked this by both installing the latest version and checking the `algorithm.pxd` file and also downloading the tag and checking the file included.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\nRun this in a jupyter notebook:\r\n```cython\r\n%%cython -a -+ -3\r\n\r\nfrom libcpp.string cimport string, npos\r\nfrom libcpp.algorithm cimport transform\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo errors\r\n\r\nInstead we get:\r\n```\r\n\r\nError compiling Cython file:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n...\r\n\r\nfrom libcpp.string cimport string, npos\r\nfrom libcpp.algorithm cimport transform\r\n^\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n/home/ddas/.cache/ipython/cython/_cython_magic_d4345cddad97905427cc9a6732292667.pyx:3:0: 'libcpp/algorithm/transform.pxd' not found\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows.
