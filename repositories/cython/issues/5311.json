Please describe.\n\nMany projects choose to treat Cython warnings as errors, which is always a bit of a concern when adding a new warning that it'll break working code.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to give users a way to mark that they've seen, considered, and want to ignore a specific warning.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@cython.silence_warnings(*something*)\r\ndef f():\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould locally ignore a certain class of warning within a function\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI'd propose the least intrusive way of doing it would be to have the `silence_warnings` decorator accept a regex string that is used to match the warning text.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nThe status quo (obviously).\r\n\r\nAssigning each warning a unique number and use that as the key to silence warnings.\n\n### Additional context\n\nWe should allow multiple `silence_warnings` decorators to be in effect simultaneously.",
