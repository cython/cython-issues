With my PR these are destructed correctly\r\n\r\nIf you dig into the C++ code it first creates an uninitialized `MyObject` temporary:\r\n\r\n    MyObject __pyx_t_1;\r\n\r\nthen for all the `self.my_object = MyObject()` assignments it just assigns from that temporary:\r\n\r\n    __pyx_v_self->my_object = __pyx_t_1;\r\n\r\nThe destructor calls you see is that temporary being destroyed at the end of `__init__`, with the arbitrary number being because it was uninitialized.\r\n\r\nYou could possibly argue that this is slightly odd code to generate. However, it's valid and there's no memory leaks or real bugs to fix here. I'm not sure a patch to treat structs and C++ classes completely identically would be practical, and it'd be hard not to break existing code (e.g. struct->dict conversion). I'll leave real decisions on this to the actual maintainers, but personally I'm not going to do anything more on this.\r\n\r\nRemember that you can always just wrap `MyObject` as `cdef cppclass MyObject` if you want Cython to treat it as a C++ class. This'll work fine (without changing the C++ source).",
