However it still appears to be used in this GIL example and associated test\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/3dc81167d1fdbf47f70b9de19cfd57bd702f4166/docs/src/userguide/external_C_code.rst?plain=1#L674-L691\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/3dc81167d1fdbf47f70b9de19cfd57bd702f4166/tests/run/nogil_conditional.pyx#L99-L120\r\n\r\nGiven the plan is to move away from conditional compilation, perhaps it is worth rewriting the example (to ensure new users don't adopt the deprecated pattern). A new corresponding test of the intended usage could also be reasonable\r\n\r\nThe existing test may be useful to keep as long as conditional compilation is supported, but perhaps a comment can be added to point out this is deprecated or legacy behavior. This may also be helpful to keep flagged so it can be more easily removed when conditional compilation is removed",
