    "body": "CPython has a specific optimization when concatenating strings - it checks the reference count of the first operand and tries to concatenate in place if possible. This is done in ceval: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/309d7cc5df4e2bf3086c49eb2b1b56b929554500/Python/ceval.c#L5354. For some specific cases this can make a big performance difference https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35787022/cython-string-concatenation-is-super-slow-what-else-does-it-do-poorly\r\n\r\nI had an initial go at it here: https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3451. However there's definite failure paths since it can `NULL` out variables that Cython isn't expecting to be `NULL`.\r\n\r\nA couple of possible options:\r\n1. It might be possible to create something with that basically re-implements `PyUnicode_Append` but without clearing operand1. (i.e. remove this line https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b146568dfcbcd7409c724f8917e4f77433dd56e4/Objects/unicodeobject.c#L11517)\r\n2. (probably easier) ensure that operand1 is always set to something on exit, even if it's a dummy value like an empty string. This could mostly be based on the current PR, but it would ocassionally lead to unexpected behaviour (mostly when exceptions are caught and handled)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      cdef unicode val = \"X\"\r\n      try:\r\n           val += \"x\"\r\n      except:\r\n           pass\r\n      return val  # wouldn't crash, but would be an odd placeholder string.\r\n```",
