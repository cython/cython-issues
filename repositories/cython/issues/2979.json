    "body": "Something seems to have happened to Python between release 2.7.12 and 2.7.15 which breaks ABI comparability of .so files compiled with Cython.  There are various references to this in Python and Debian bug trackers but I have not found a workaround.  One suggested workaround has you build your own _cytoolz_ package but I could not find _cytoolz_ being used by Cython in my environment.  Maybe that is for cpython and cpython is a different compiler?\r\n\r\nI believe the _PyFPE_jbuf_ symbol comes from a compiler option called _fpectl_.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to get or build a version of the Cython package which builds .so files without a reference to PyFPE_jbuf and which runs on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86_64?\r\n\r\nIt just seems to me that since we put these into wheels that are named like _foo-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl_ they should run without incident under any 2.7 version of Python.\r\n",
