The \"limited API\" is really different in many regards, so this means a lot of duplicated C code and quite a bit longer C files. As macro guard, I would suggest a new macro `CYTHON_USE_LIMITED_API` that would `#define Py_LIMITED_API` before including `Python.h`, disable most of the special feature flags in the beginning of `ModuleSetupCode.c`, and activate separate implementations for extension types. We'd then need additional guards around several macro calls in optimised code, and it would probably also conflict with `CyFunction` (`binding=True`), possibly also with generators and coroutines, can't say. Anything that cannot work with the limited API would then simply generate a C compile time `#error`.\r\n\r\nPull request welcome.",

That means that for the transformation, you can follow the description in [PEP 384](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/), activate the feature switch macro in the test suite, and the C compiler errors will guide you through the process. And since most of the C code is generated in a single point, it's not even that much code to change overall.\r\n\r\nThere's one caveat: it still needs to generate the same code as before when the feature is disabled, and the code generation must stay maintainable. Some things will therefore have to be duplicated or (preferably) hidden behind new `__Pyx_â€¦` macros, such as extension type slots (a macro like `__Pyx_SLOT(tp_slotname, value)` would simply unfold into `value,` in the normal case and `{\"tp_slot\", value},` if value is not `0` in the limited API case, something like that).\r\n\r\nAgain, pull request welcome.",

I consider the proposed feature a way to make the life of distributors easier, in cases where performance is not critical (e.g. for a wrapper of an I/O bound native library).\r\n\r\nThe reason why the compilation takes a while is because Cython generates code that allows the C compiler to pull all sorts of tricks to specialise and optimise the code for the target platform at hand. Meaning, if it's really just about the compilation time, It's usually worth waiting for the result. :)\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use travis or a parallel Docker manylinux build for the different Python versions, then generating all wheels doesn't take that much longer than generating one, from my experience.",

            "body": "> Hello, I was experimenting again with setting CYTHON_LIMITED_API define macro. Is it expected and normal that, e.g. if I build the *.abi3.so with python3.8 and then try to import it from python3.9 I get a warning that the compiletime version does not much the runtime version?\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> RuntimeWarning: compiletime version 3.8 of module 'cu2qu.cu2qu' does not match runtime version 3.9\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI just found myself in the same situation. I think this warning may confuse users compiling with `CYTHON_LIMITED_API`. Somebody using this feature actually wants to compile with one unique Python 3.x and be able to run with multiple Python >= 3.x. There are already other functions being preprocessed based on `CYTHON_COMPILING_IN_LIMITED_API`, and `__Pyx_check_binary_version` seems to need it too:\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/ddaaa7b8bfe9885b7bed432cd0a5ab8191d112cd/Cython/Utility/ModuleSetupCode.c#L1550-L1563\r\n\r\nOne possibility would be to skip the `RuntimeError` in the case of the limited API:\r\n```python\r\nstatic int __Pyx_check_binary_version(void) {\r\n    #if !CYTHON_COMPILING_IN_LIMITED_API\r\n    char ctversion[4], rtversion[4];\r\n    PyOS_snprintf(ctversion, 4, \"%d.%d\", PY_MAJOR_VERSION, PY_MINOR_VERSION);\r\n    PyOS_snprintf(rtversion, 4, \"%s\", Py_GetVersion());\r\n    if (ctversion[0] != rtversion[0] || ctversion[2] != rtversion[2]) {\r\n        char message[200];\r\n        PyOS_snprintf(message, sizeof(message),\r\n                      \"compile time version %s of module '%.100s' \"\r\n                      \"does not match runtime version %s\",\r\n                      ctversion, __Pyx_MODULE_NAME, rtversion);\r\n        return PyErr_WarnEx(NULL, message, 1);\r\n    }\r\n    #endif\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnother possibility would be to restrict the version check in the limited API case so that the `RuntimeError` is only triggered if the library was compiled with Python 3.x and the runtime corresponds to a version older than 3.x. The warning even has a typo when thrown in Python 3.10, since it is reported as running Python 3.1.",

I then tried it with a simple caching example that uses ints, dicts and lists, and got a bit more than a 10% slowdown for the Limited API case. So, there are visible differences in the tricks that Cython pulls in the C-API, but in the end, these tricks have to add up to reach that difference, and are obviously highly code specific.",
