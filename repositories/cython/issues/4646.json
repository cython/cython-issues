    "body": "In a Python class that inherits from multiple Cython classes we found that sometimes method calls don't work as expected for `cpdef` functions that are overridden in the Python class. This results in the wrong (completely unrelated) functions being called or, as in the example below, a segfault.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class A:\r\n    cdef f(self): pass\r\n\r\ncdef class B(A):\r\n    cpdef g(self):\r\n        print(\"B\")\r\n\r\ncdef class C(A):\r\n    cdef A a\r\n\r\nclass D(B, C):\r\n    def g(self):\r\n        print(\"D\")\r\n\r\ndef crash(x):\r\n    x.g()\r\n    (<B>x).g()\r\n\r\ncrash(D())\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cythonize -a -i crash.pyx\r\n$ python -c 'import crash'\r\nD\r\nsegmentation fault\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe expected this not to segfault.\r\n\r\nWe understand that multiple inheritance is not always possible so maybe this is not supposed to actually work. However, Python did not complain about a lay-out problem here when creating the type `D`.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Python version 3.10.1\r\n - Cython version, both 0.29.27 & 3.0.0a10 (as shipped by [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/cython-feedstock).)",
