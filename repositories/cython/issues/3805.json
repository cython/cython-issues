And this is even with `embedsignature=True`.\r\n\r\nI set up a [demo example](https://github.com/matham/cython_demo_project/blob/enum/cython_demo_project/numeric.pyx) so you can see it [failing](https://github.com/matham/cython_demo_project/runs/1063256000?check_suite_focus=true) in the [tests](https://github.com/matham/cython_demo_project/blob/enum/cython_demo_project/tests/test_doc.py#L8): \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFirst I tried the class syntax, like python's enum:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ncpdef enum Numbers:\r\n    \"\"\"Number list.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    one = 1\r\n    two = 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that gives:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError compiling Cython file:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n...\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        return self.a + self.b\r\n\r\n\r\ncpdef enum Numbers:\r\n    \"\"\"Number list.\"\"\"\r\n   ^\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\ncython_demo_project\\numeric.pyx:22:4: Expected an identifier\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I tried:\r\n```py\r\ncpdef enum Numbers:\r\n    one = 1\r\n    two = 2\r\n\"\"\"Number list.\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nBut that gives:\r\n```py\r\n>>> print(Numbers.__doc__)\r\nAn enumeration.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nMy ultimate goal is to have the docs show up in sphinx doc generation. But, currently it doesn't seem to be at all included by Cython in the generated code.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - Python version: 3.7.3.\r\n - Cython version 0.29.21\r\n",
