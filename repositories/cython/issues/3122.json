It also can't tell where in a generator expression locals actually is, so fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef locals_actually_in_generator():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    >>> \"x\" in locals_actually_in_generator()\r\n    True\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return list(locals() for x in range(1))\r\n\r\ndef locals_actually_in_dictexpr():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    >>> \"x\" in locals_actually_in_dictexpr()\r\n    True\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return {'a': locals() for x in range(1)}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is beyond me (and pretty unimportant really - I only ran into it when trying to prepare some test-cases for something else)",
