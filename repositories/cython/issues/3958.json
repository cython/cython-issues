Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nString literals with underscores (e.g. \"1_2_3\") are backported to work on older Python versions. However, this only works when the type is known to be a string/bytes type. It also depends on the output type that's being coerced to.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\npassthrough = lambda x: x\r\n\r\ndef f():\r\n    float(\"1_2_3\")  # OK, goes through __Pyx_PyString_AsDouble\r\n    float(passthrough(\"1_2_3\"))  # OK, goes through __Pyx_PyObject_AsDouble\r\n    [float(\"1_2_3\")]  # OK, goes through __Pyx_PyString_AsDouble\r\n    [float(passthrough(\"1_2_3\"))]  # FAIL - goes through __Pyx_PyNumber_Float (which just calls \"float\" constructor)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNot 100% sure what the expected behaviour should be. Probably something consistent though\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Python version 2.7 (and I think older 3.x versions too)\r\n - Cython version: master\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is the reason that the builtin_float test is currently failing. On that `fix_underscores` returns a Python object of unknown type.\r\n",
