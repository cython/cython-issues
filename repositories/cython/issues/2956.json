    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been reading Cython's documentation lately, and I fell on maybe a little mistake on [\"Working with Python arrays\"](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/array.html). In the API reference here's what we can read:\r\n\r\n> ```int resize_smart(array self, Py_ssize_t n) except -1```\r\n> Efficient for small increments; uses growth pattern that delivers amortized linear-time appends.\r\n\r\nSo that basically it says it gives amortized linear-time appends, shouldn't it be amortized constant time appends ? Just like with [C++ vectors](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/) ?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAdel",

But the \"amortized\" suggests (or requires) a series of appends, which then all run in a time that is amortized linear with the number of appends.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind changing it to constant, though. PR welcome.",
