    "body": "The parse function structure of the parser implementation in `Cython/Compiler/Parsing.py` has diverged from the old Grammar in CPython and certainly does not match the new PEG parser. Additionally, several flags were added over time that make it less clear what kind of expression is allowed and supposed to be parsed where. This ticket asks to\r\n\r\n- adapt the parse function split and their names to what CPython uses in its own parser, as closely as possible (but keeping the `p_` prefix for readability)\r\n- remove flag options where possible and reasonable\r\n- split parse functions that currently take options into separate functions that parse different things, and use them in the appropriate places.\r\n\r\nBasically, it should be clear from the name of a called parse function in which state the parser now changes and what it is allowed to see next. This state should not depend on additional options (\"parse X next, unless I'm telling you not to do what I'm asking you to do\").\r\n\r\nThis can (and should best) be done in multiple iterations, both to keep the changes easy to review and to allow us to see where we are going along the way.\r\n\r\nKnown fields that require a cleanup are\r\n- [ ] `p_test()` as entry point for expressions\r\n- [ ] the integration of lambda expressions\r\n- [ ] star expressions\r\n- [ ] conditional expressions\r\n- [ ] named expressions (walrus operator)\r\n\r\nAlong the way, the following missing syntax features can be added:\r\n- [ ] parenthesised context managers (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#new-features)\r\n- [ ] general expressions as decorators (#4570, [PEP 614](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/))\r\n\r\nThe [Python test suite](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/test) has tests for them.\r\n\r\nCPython's old parser grammar: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Grammar/Grammar\r\nCPython's new PEG parser grammar: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Grammar/python.gram",

So run `cython somefile.pyx` on Python 3.7 should produce the same code as running it on Python 3.11 alpha.\r\n\r\nLet's suppose we tried to implement `match ...: case...` using the `ast` module.

If/when we do implement `match ...: case` statements we would aim for them to work on all the Python versions that we support.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure what the AST looks like for PyPy (which we also support) and GraalPython (which we don't really support, but may do in sometime in the future).

But it's probably a dependency for Cython rather than the users (i.e. we'd distribute the files it generated).\r\n\r\nThe big benefit would be we'd have a grammar file that's automatically in-sync with Cython's parser, which would help people trying to do syntax highlighting or similar\r\n\r\nThe downsides would be:\r\n* we'd be replacing a large chunk of code that's tested and (mostly) works with something completely new. That's like to lead to a lot of regressions, especially for things like C++ templates where we probably don't have complete test coverage of everything that works right now,\r\n* I dunno how easy or hard it'd be to link to the current scanner (that's a complete \"don't know\"... might be perfectly simple)\r\n* It seems like it'd be hard to do gradually?",

So I don't think our current parser is actually holding anything back.\r\n\r\n> > It's somewhere between 3.2 and never.\r\n>\r\n> Then what lowest python version needs to be supported?\r\n\r\nI don't want to speak for @scoder but my interpretation is:\r\n* it'd be too much effort to do for Cython 3.0 - Cython 3.0 is _hopefully_ out sooner than we could make this kind of change\r\n* it doesn't need to be in Cython 3.0: if changing the parser was done right then it should be invisible to the user, and the priority for Cython 3.0 is to get breaking changes done in one go.\r\n* It isn't in Cython 3.1 because that is intended to be fairly quick after 3.0.\r\n* The version of Python probably isn't an issue - it'd be possible to ship the generated files rather than require users to run pegen.\r\n* So \"3.2 to never\" really means \"maybe sometime in the future if there's a good reason to do it and someone is motivated to do the work\"",
