Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3883 and https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3910, should `typing.Union` be interpreted as a fused type? (It'd obviously need to be ignored in `cdef class`es and maybe a few other contexts since you wouldn't want it to break anything in places where fused types can't be used)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nIt's not completely obvious that this is the right thing to do. Thus I'm not proposing to put it in the initial implementation of `typing`. But it's probably a reasonable interpretation of the type.\r\n",

So something like `Union[list, tuple]` (or `Union[List, Tuple]`) would really translate to `Union[list, tuple, object]`. Which, BTW, is always a safe fallback to have. It just generates more code, as well as a runtime performance hit when entering Python functions.\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, we can still add a directive to disable it later. It shouldn't hurt much to do this unconditionally to start with. (Note that any additional directive effectively cuts our test coverage in half.)",
