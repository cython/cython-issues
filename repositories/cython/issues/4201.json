Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3883 and https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/3910, should `typing.Union` be interpreted as a fused type? (It'd obviously need to be ignored in `cdef class`es and maybe a few other contexts since you wouldn't want it to break anything in places where fused types can't be used)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nIt's not completely obvious that this is the right thing to do. Thus I'm not proposing to put it in the initial implementation of `typing`. But it's probably a reasonable interpretation of the type.\r\n",
