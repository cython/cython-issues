    "body": "We now support the normal Python comparison methods like `__eq__()` etc., but it would simplify their usage to auto-generate the obvious mappings when the `@functools.total_ordering` decorator is used. At the C level, this could probably be done without a performance penalty.\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.total_ordering\r\n\r\nSince this only applies to cdef classes, it seems better to use a safe and dedicated separate decorator `@cython.total_ordering` than to rely on the generic Python decorator.\r\n\r\nApproach:\r\n- Support the new decorator as a new directive in `Options.py`, similar to `@no_gc_clear`.\r\n- In `generate_richcmp_function()` (in `ModuleNode.py`), add default implementations of the missing comparison functions to the C switch statement if the directive is set.\r\n- Add a new test file `tests/run/exttype_total_ordering.pyx`, implement different cdef class configurations in it, and test their comparisons with Python doctests. You can also implement normal Python classes in these doctests for direct comparison of Python's own behaviour.\r\n- Run the tests with `python[2|3] runtests.py -vv --debug exttype_total_ordering`. The generated code can be found in the `TEST_TMP/run/c/` directory.",

Renaming the decorator can still be done later.\n",
