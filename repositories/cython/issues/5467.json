It would be very useful for these wheels to be build and published, to start early testing for many of the root dependencies in the Python package ecosystem. This could either be done for the existing [3.0.0b3](https://github.com/cython/cython/releases/tag/3.0.0b3) release, or the next one. Especially projects like NumPy could benefit a lot from early Python 3.12 wheels (see also https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23824).",
