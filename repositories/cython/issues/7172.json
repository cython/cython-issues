Use either `@register(some_class)` or plain `@register` on an annotated function.\n```\n\nIs it a feature or a bug?\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\nclass A:\n    @functools.singledispatchmethod\n    @classmethod\n    def f(cls, x):\n        print(\"Fallback\")\n\n    @f.register\n    @classmethod\n    def _(cls, x: int):\n        print(\"int\")\n\na = A()\na.f(1)\na.f(\"1\")\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nIt should print:\n```\nint\nFallback\n```\n\n### OS\n\nUbuntu 22.04.5 LTS\n\n### Python version\n\n3.10.12\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.4\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
