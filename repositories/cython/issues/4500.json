I've tried to debug it using gdb, but I cannot tell what's causing the failure. Maybe my backport is incorrect or there is some other problem in Cython. See [2] for full gdb output.

I remember doing some cleanups and fixing several issues with coroutines for recent CPython features such as limited API support, extension type specs and what not. Can't say how much of that went into 0.29.x. Probably not everything, given that 0.29.x is pretty much in bug-fix-only mode and has been for a while. I'm not saying that that's necessarily the issue here, but I'm not surprised that the change is not stand-alone.",
