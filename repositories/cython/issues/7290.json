This also works.\n\nOnly some of the changes in that patch relate to imports, so I also tried the following patch, which only reverts part of a67f0401995318ba99f98ddfd29220f60dbe3d32. This also works.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/Cython/Utility/ImportExport.c b/Cython/Utility/ImportExport.c\nindex 283c64d71..270eae42d 100644\n--- a/Cython/Utility/ImportExport.c\n+++ b/Cython/Utility/ImportExport.c\n@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@\n-/////////////// Import.proto ///////////////\n+/////////////// Import.export ///////////////\n \n static PyObject *__Pyx_Import(PyObject *name, PyObject *const *imported_names, Py_ssize_t len_imported_names, PyObject *qualname, int level); /*proto*/\n \n```\n\nI have a theory about why this error happens.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the commit is moving code from being duplicated into every generated C file to being one shared copy.\n\nWhen it calls the shared copy, it calls `PyImport_ImportModuleLevelObject`. One of the arguments to this function is the globals of the module attempting import. [Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/import.html#c.PyImport_ImportModuleLevelObject)\n\n```\n            /* try package relative import first */\n            module = PyImport_ImportModuleLevelObject(\n                name, NAMED_CGLOBAL(moddict_cname), empty_dict, from_list, 1);\n```\n\nThat appears to use the globals of the shared module. According to a comment in CPython, \"The 'globals' argument is used to infer where the import is occurring to handle relative imports.\" [Source](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.14/Lib/importlib/_bootstrap.py#L1465).\n\nMy best guess is that the three conditions necessary to trigger the bug are:\n\n1. Using a shared Cython library.\n2. Attempting a relative import.\n3. The shared Cython library and module attempting a relative import are in different directories.\n",

See linked PR for more details.\n\nAlso, since the previous PR was concerned with code size, I wanted to make a comparison of how many lines each approach takes.\n\nI compared how many lines of code were added and removed by various solutions, when looking at the code generated for all of SciPy's Cython. (Numbers were found via `grep -R -l \"/* Generated by Cython\" build | xargs wc -l`)\n\nHere is a table comparing how much generated code each version of Cython creates.\n\n| Version                  | Generated Lines | Lines added VS 3.2.0 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| 3.1.6                    |         1650951 |               118657 |\n| 3.2.0                    |         1532294 |                    0 |\n| njo-export-test |         1539324 |                 7030 |\n| #7292      |         1532726 |                  432 |\n\nThe branch njo-export-test is a branch with [this diff](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7290#issuecomment-3499181865). The branch #7292 both fixes the test failure, and uses many fewer lines to accomplish it. Therefore I think it is the best option here.\n\nAs a side note, if I'm reading this right, Cython removed 100K lines of code off of our build between 3.1.6 and 3.2.0. That is some really incredible work that I am very appreciative of.",
