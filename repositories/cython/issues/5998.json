On MSVC, `_pyx_t_double_complex` is defined as `typedef struct { double real, imag; } __pyx_t_double_comple` since MSVC doesn't appear to have proper support for `_Complex`. Since C doesn't have operator overloading, the above line doesn't compile.\r\n\r\nWhen not adding to an array, cython generates code that uses `__Pyx_c_sum_double` instead of `+=`\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\nfrom cpython cimport array\r\nimport array\r\ncdef array.array a = array.array('c', [1, 2, 3])\r\ncdef double complex [:] ca = a\r\n\r\nca[0] += 5j\r\n\r\nprint(ca[0])\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nCython should emit `__Pyx_c_sum_double` instead of `+=` when adding to arrays same as adding to a complex variable.\n\n### OS\n\nWindows, MSVC\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.8\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
