One thing to consider is whether it'll be using too many CI resources, but there's already a cron that runs once a week, so maybe we can use that to upload a nightly (we can even just change the cron to run twice a week, like NumPy does for example). Other than that, it should be relatively straightforward to set up. If you agree, I can work on it.",

It means only a single wheel is needed because it's just Python code.\r\n\r\nCompiling Cython does make it slightly faster (so is probably net worthwhile for a release where many people will be using it) but that's really the only difference so doesn't seem worth it for a lightly-used nightly build.",
