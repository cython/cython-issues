    "body": "Hello, I'm kinda new to Cython so hopefully I didn't miss anything obvious, but I think I've found a weird behavior of annotated function arguments.\r\nSeems like the ```__class__``` attribute acts unexpectedly when the arguments are annotated with pythonic \r\n\r\n```cython\r\ndef func(dict my_dict):\r\n    # The following prints \"<class 'dict'>\" as expected\r\n    print(my_dict.__class__)\r\n\r\n    # I would expect the following to print \"{}\" since this is the equivalent of dict()\r\n    # Instead, it once again prints \"<class 'dict'>\r\n    print(my_dict.__class__())\r\n\r\n    # Calling the class twice would create an empty dict and print \"{}\"\r\n    print(my_dict.__class__()())\r\n```\r\nRemoving the \"dict\" annotation from \"my_dict\" would make this function work as expected\r\n(printing \"<class 'dict'> followed by \"{}\" followed by an exception for calling a 'dict' object)\r\n\r\nThis behavior also occurs with other python types such as strings, lists and sets.\r\nHowever, when using ints, it behaved has expected.\r\n\r\nI'm using Cython 0.29.21 with Python 3.9.1 on Windows.",
