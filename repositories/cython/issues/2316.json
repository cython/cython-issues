Assuming there is no easy work-around, I'd lean towards considering this a reduction, always. We document the in-place operators to mean a reduction inside of `prange` loops, so users should be aware of it and not be *too* surprised. I'd rather make it an error if an in-place operator usage *cannot* be implemented as a reduction by Cython, to make users aware of the difference and avoid unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\n(Ok, you can probably rearrange the loop nesting to avoid array reductions, but you may loose efficiency that way…)",
