    "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently the recommended method for building Cython modules is [using setuptools via setup.py](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/build.html). While this is still completely valid, the general trend of the Python packaging ecosystem is to move away from this pattern. This is true in multiple respects:\r\n- [setuptools is migrating away from arbitrary code in setup.py to a static setup.cfg config file](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#transitioning-from-setup-py-to-setup-cfg)\r\n- [PEP 517 specifies how to define build backends other than setuptools](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)\r\n- Support for more complex builds involving Cython and extensive C/C++ libraries has dramatically improved over the years with the advent of tools like [`meson-python`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python) and [`scikit-build`](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/)\r\n\r\nI do not know if Cython has any plans for supporting setup.cfg files (I wasn't able to find anything in the issue tracker), nor do I have enough knowledge of Cython internals to propose a plan for how Cython could be integrated into a setup.cfg-based build. For projects leveraging tools like meson or CMake, though, it there is a fairly should be possible to chart a reasonable path forward here.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nThe general pattern for Python builds using an underlying build system is to use `cython` to transpile Cython code into C/C++ and then to manage compilation of the resulting source file using the build generator (as opposed to using `cythonize`) since that allows users to leverage the full features of the build system to control the compilation. I do not personally make use of Meson, but I do have experience with CMake and scikit-build. To help facilitate the transition for Cython users using more extensive CMake-based builds, I would like for Cython to provide a CMake module that (at minimum) defines a function that can be used to run the `cython` CLI and generate code with it. This function would provide an interface to all the command line flags for the `cython` CLI and handle any necessary preprocessing. The resulting module could then be used by e.g. `scikit-build` users or those manually handling CMake-based compilation.\r\n\r\nIf the developers are interested in this feature, I am happy to contribute it in a PR.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n[`scikit-build` currently provides a `UseCython.cmake` module for this purpose](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/blob/main/skbuild/resources/cmake/UseCython.cmake). However, the successor package [`scikit-build-core`](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core) does not. I originally considered porting the functionality there, but the Cython project itself seems like a more appropriate home for this logic. Moreover, putting this code into Cython would allow other builders to also take advantage of it instead of relying on `scikit-build-core`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe one caveat with putting this module into Cython is that if Cython is installed via pip the module will go into the Python site-packages prefix. This location will not be on CMake's module search path by default, unlike if it was installed directly into the primary $PREFIX directly (e.g. a system /usr/lib directory equivalent, or perhaps a conda env prefix). That means that users would either need to query Python's CLI using a CMake custom command to get the site directory, or CMake would need to add support for this directly. Some discussion of that is in [the CMake issue I originally opened regarding Cython support](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/24982).",

By supplying a cmake/cython-config.cmake file in the PyPI package, `find_package(cython)` will work out-of-the-box in [scikit-build-core](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core) (and therefore eventually in scikit-build classic too). (As mentioned above, there's a bit of querying that you'd have to do if you are using CMake directly; that can be simplified a little by providing a helper function that produces the location of the cmake module; and I'm hoping to improve support for this in CMake in the future.)\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this, I could either help develop or eventually contribute the file.",
