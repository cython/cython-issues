    "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently the recommended method for building Cython modules is [using setuptools via setup.py](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/build.html). While this is still completely valid, the general trend of the Python packaging ecosystem is to move away from this pattern. This is true in multiple respects:\r\n- [setuptools is migrating away from arbitrary code in setup.py to a static setup.cfg config file](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#transitioning-from-setup-py-to-setup-cfg)\r\n- [PEP 517 specifies how to define build backends other than setuptools](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)\r\n- Support for more complex builds involving Cython and extensive C/C++ libraries has dramatically improved over the years with the advent of tools like [`meson-python`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python) and [`scikit-build`](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/)\r\n\r\nI do not know if Cython has any plans for supporting setup.cfg files (I wasn't able to find anything in the issue tracker), nor do I have enough knowledge of Cython internals to propose a plan for how Cython could be integrated into a setup.cfg-based build. For projects leveraging tools like meson or CMake, though, it there is a fairly should be possible to chart a reasonable path forward here.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nThe general pattern for Python builds using an underlying build system is to use `cython` to transpile Cython code into C/C++ and then to manage compilation of the resulting source file using the build generator (as opposed to using `cythonize`) since that allows users to leverage the full features of the build system to control the compilation. I do not personally make use of Meson, but I do have experience with CMake and scikit-build. To help facilitate the transition for Cython users using more extensive CMake-based builds, I would like for Cython to provide a CMake module that (at minimum) defines a function that can be used to run the `cython` CLI and generate code with it. This function would provide an interface to all the command line flags for the `cython` CLI and handle any necessary preprocessing. The resulting module could then be used by e.g. `scikit-build` users or those manually handling CMake-based compilation.\r\n\r\nIf the developers are interested in this feature, I am happy to contribute it in a PR.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n[`scikit-build` currently provides a `UseCython.cmake` module for this purpose](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/blob/main/skbuild/resources/cmake/UseCython.cmake). However, the successor package [`scikit-build-core`](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core) does not. I originally considered porting the functionality there, but the Cython project itself seems like a more appropriate home for this logic. Moreover, putting this code into Cython would allow other builders to also take advantage of it instead of relying on `scikit-build-core`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe one caveat with putting this module into Cython is that if Cython is installed via pip the module will go into the Python site-packages prefix. This location will not be on CMake's module search path by default, unlike if it was installed directly into the primary $PREFIX directly (e.g. a system /usr/lib directory equivalent, or perhaps a conda env prefix). That means that users would either need to query Python's CLI using a CMake custom command to get the site directory, or CMake would need to add support for this directly. Some discussion of that is in [the CMake issue I originally opened regarding Cython support](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/24982).",

By supplying a cmake/cython-config.cmake file in the PyPI package, `find_package(cython)` will work out-of-the-box in [scikit-build-core](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core) (and therefore eventually in scikit-build classic too). (As mentioned above, there's a bit of querying that you'd have to do if you are using CMake directly; that can be simplified a little by providing a helper function that produces the location of the cmake module; and I'm hoping to improve support for this in CMake in the future.)\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this, I could either help develop or eventually contribute the file.",

Then it's just a matter of adding an example of how to add the necessary site-packages dir to the search path using vanilla CMake as you mentioned, Marc showed us the necessary CMake vars in the other discussion.",

It's a fairly direct translation of the cython CLI to CMake. I didn't want to do any of the extra magic that scikit-build classic's UseCython.cmake did since with a proper CMake setup that should be handled by the caller using `target_include_directories`, but let me know if you disagree with that approach (and of course with any other bits here). If you think this looks solid we can see what the Cython devs think about me upstreaming this into Cython (along with some documentation).",

I think there are tradeoffs here.\r\nPros:\r\n- Copying the CLI allows us to control the argument list a little more cleanly, e.g. we can prevent users from specifying an output directory (which this module should probably manage directly.\r\n- It simplifies internal parsing of some pieces like determining what file extensions to use, and it makes it easier to validate inputs.\r\n- It allows us to have different defaults if there are cases where it may make sense to use a different default in the context of CMake. For example, it might make sense to set the `--gdb` flag based on `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- It requires keeping a set of mappings up-to-date. If `cython` adds or changes options, the cython-config.cmake will have to change as well. This is additional maintenance that Cython devs may want to avoid.\r\n- It requires users to learn a second set of arguments instead of directly using the ones they're familiar with. I suspect that this argument is partially moot, however, since I think most users of Cython go the `setup.py` route and don't invoke `Cython` directly anyway.\r\n\r\nThere are probably other considerations as well. Copying the CLI was my first thought, but I could be convinced to go either way depending on how others feel about it.",

It looks like Meson's `cython_args` support is documented [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-tables.html#language-arguments-parameter-names), but Meson's approach is different enough that my changes are the equivalent for CMake AFAICT.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to support something like `CMAKE_CYTHON_ARGS` as well to mirror e.g. `CMAKE_CXX_ARGS`, but I'd rather not do that via a third-party config file. It would be different if we were hoping to add this config directly into CMake, but if it's living in a third-party package like Cython then I think it would be confusing to name it in a way that suggests a CMake built-in. We could introduce the variable with a different name, but I don't think the benefits outweigh the costs (more complex and difficult to understand resolution order as Robert illustrated for CXX flags above).",
