    "body": "[Conditional compilation](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#conditional-compilation) is a feature that was inherited from Pyrex that never had a high standing amongst the Cython developers. It also takes up quite a bit of code space in the syntax nodes and the parser and allows incorrect user assumptions about the data values used in the code (e.g. the precision of floating point numbers).\r\n\r\nSee the discussion in https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4287\r\n\r\nI would like to deprecate it in Cython 3.0 and add a warning.\r\n~It could be one of the things that we remove for Cython 3.1.~ It will not be removed in Cython 3.1, but continue to be available for another couple of release series, so that users have enough time to move away from it.\r\n\r\nUsages of `DEF` should be replaced by:\r\n- global cdef constants\r\n- global enums (C or Python)\r\n- C macros, e.g. defined in [verbatim C code sections](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/external_C_code.html#including-verbatim-c-code)\r\n\r\nUsages of `IF` should be replaced by:\r\n- leaving out unused C struct field names from a Cython struct definition (which does not have to be complete)\r\n- redefining a struct type under different Cython names, with different (e.g. version/platform dependent) attributes, but - runtime conditions with the [same cname string](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/external_C_code.html#resolving-naming-conflicts-c-name-specifications).\r\n- separating out optional (non-trivial) functionality into optional Cython modules and importing/using them at need\r\n- code generation, as a last resort\r\n\r\nIt is generally preferable to take a C compiler related decision at C compile time rather than Cython translation time. This avoids having to generate multiple versions of the C file. Especially platform dependent adaptations are really best handled in C macros, e.g.\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from \"some_external_lib.h\":\r\n    \"\"\"\"\r\n    #define HAS_NEWLY_ADDED_FIELD (C_LIB_VERSION >= 20)\r\n\r\n    #if HAS_NEWLY_ADDED_FIELD\r\n        #define _mylib_get_newly_added_field(a_struct_ptr)  ((a_struct_ptr)->newly_added_field)\r\n    #else\r\n        #define _mylib_get_newly_added_field(a_struct_ptr)  (0)\r\n    #endif\r\n    \"\"\"\"\r\n    bint HAS_NEWLY_ADDED_FIELD\r\n    int get_newly_added_field \"_mylib_get_newly_added_field\" (struct_ptr)\r\n\r\nif HAS_NEWLY_ADDED_FIELD:\r\n    print(get_newly_added_field(some_struct_ptr))\r\n```",

The conditional statements (' IF'  etc.) are trivial compared to that. They are just a wart in the language.\r\n\r\nI would personally like to see `IF` removed, at some point. I could live with keeping a way to define constants, although I don't think they'd have to be handled by the compiler. We already do constant folding (although we do not inject all constant values in the end, e.g. floats to prevent loss/gain of precision). I could imagine something like a `cython.once()` which would make sure that an expression is only evaluated once (and then cached, or, if compile time constant, injected as a constant at compile time). OTOH, I'm not sure it's worth breaking existing code for that.\r\n\r\nThe [use case in SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/44e31b1eb202ef91caad059952ba268d2610a60b/scipy/stats/biasedurn.pyx.templ#L77) is an exemplary one, if I understand it correctly. It seems to be using template code generation to inject a constant flag, but then uses `IF` to switch between different code sections. Why not use the templating language for that?\r\n\r\nI'm sure users are still writing such code as we're discussing this, and IMHO they shouldn't. I've added a warning to the documentation and would also like to add a visible compile time deprecation warning. Would that be ok for everyone?\r\n\r\nThen we can discuss the removal again in a couple of years from now, maybe with a better standing.",

I [added examples](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/external_C_code.html#including-verbatim-c-code) to the docs.\r\n\r\nFor simple cases, I'd resort to writing C macro shims that give different implementations a common interface.\r\n\r\nFor more complex cases, especially with different but similar backend libraries, I'd consider implementing separate low-level extension modules and importing one or the other. I do not mean duplicating all of CuPy, not at all. But I'd investigate, for example, if I could provide a (shallow) common wrapper type with C methods that I could subclass into different implementations that work with different libraries in the end. That way, the different low-level structs and API differences would stay inside of those low-level modules, and the main user level API modules would only talk to the internal API of the low-level modules.\r\n\r\nSo, basically, the idea is to hide differences behind another level of indirection.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is what I would do when designing a new system. Applying this to an existing code base, especially an existing large code base, is … probably not done lightly. I'm aware that this is an issue.",

The two main alternatives are:\r\n* Move the conditional compilation into C (often more robust, but we realize it relies on people being familiar with C),\r\n* Use code generation or a template engine (they're kind of the same thing). This is likely to be the main recommendation for most cases. It's possible currently but we want to add tools to make it much easier to put into the build pipeline.\r\nWe won't be removing anything until well after those tools are available and people have had time to use them.\r\n\r\nThe current situation is something like \"Cython core developers don't like this feature and would like to replace it with a better alternative\". It's a statement of intent rather than immediate action. The main consequence right now is that we aren't interesting in proposals extend the current conditional complication feature.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's necessary to do a comprehensive Github search and open issues on every project that uses this feature. We'll make sure that suitable warnings appear in Cython well before anything removes, and that the alternatives are well-documented. Until then I'd wait (especially with respect to existing code).",

It would be enough to define constants in `setup.py` and add them to some internal namespace. Or finally implement `cdef const ... =`. Or, inject them with code generation, which covers a whole lot more use cases.\r\n\r\nAfter running into these deprecations in SciPy, a few thoughts on this. SciPy uses `DEF` in a lot of files, almost exclusively to define constants (e.g., tolerances and magic numbers for special functions). Out of the suggested alternatives here:\r\n\r\n- `cdef const` sounds like a very nice thing to have here.\r\n- `setup.py` is not available, since we're no longer using `distutils` (true for more and more projects). Either way, needing a separate namespace for some constants seems cumbersome.\r\n- Code generation + Cython is _extremely expensive_ development & maintenance wise. The problem is not doing the templating and code generation, the problem is the combination of an out-of-place build system (mandatory for Meson, good practice for CMake) and the path-dependence of Cython's name determination for extensions. Cython + generated sources has been our number one problem during build system migration. Getting more of those problems just to define constants is not a good thing.\r\n\r\nIs there a chance `cdef const` is on its way to being implemented?",

Adding one is really bad for everyone because it always means that users will switch them on and forget about them, and then we're back to deprecation step 0 when we really want to change the behaviour later.\r\n\r\nAFAICT and IMHO, we currently have three directives for undesired behaviour (I noted the defaults below):\r\n- `allow_none_for_extension_args=True` (this is the wrong default but it predates `Optional[]` by years)\r\n- `preliminary_late_includes_cy28=False` (we never implemented the intended replacement)\r\n- `legacy_implicit_noexcept=False` (it just takes time to adapt large existing code bases)\r\nand we now discuss adding a fourth one:\r\n- `legacy_conditional_compilation=False`\r\n\r\nThat's already quite a bunch, and their effects are largely untested because they have a fixed value for (almost) the entire test suite. We should have less of those, not more. Adding a compiler directive (especially for legacy features) has a very high cost.\r\n\r\nReally, we also should not add this one. The reasons why we still do it are that 1) it can be overwhelming for larger projects to replace all their usages, 2) the option can be disabled gradually per module while migrating step by step, 3) it's not always trivial and obvious which replacement to chose, and 4) there may still be use cases for which we don't have a \"good enough\" answer. The last one is the real reason why I admit this in.\r\n",

The main user-side problem is `IF`, more than `DEF`. However, the main internal source of complexity is `DEF`, not `IF`, so getting rid of `IF` without also ripping out `DEF` isn't going to help *us* much.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Since there's not much use to the warning until that point, given that this is by some distance the most common use case for `DEF`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that is the case, but I can't bring up numbers. We've seen several examples in this discussion where `const` globals were not the best solution. I listed several possible solutions in the ticket description above. I do agree that `const` globals would generally be a nice feature and could help in many cases. It's ugly in Python code, though, as it stands.\r\n\r\nIn foreign tickets, I regularly sense a lack of guidance as to what users should do to solve their specific problem. It's also difficult to give general advice here. The fact that the feature existed made many developers use it without thinking about better solutions. Deprecating it now means that they have to go back to their old code and find new solutions for each of their use cases. That is work. Work, that is probably better spent writing code and solving the problems of their users.",

Cython parses these as floating point numbers, saves them as Python floats (i.e. C double) internally, and writes them back out using normal Python float serialisation (which, in modern Python 3, tries to find the shortest exact string representation of the 64-bit value). There is no guarantee about the exact fraction digits that you will find in the generated C code, and it depends on the Python implementation/version. Here's the `EULER` constant in Python 3.10:\r\n```python\r\n>>> 0.577215664901532860606512090082402431\r\n0.5772156649015329\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is different from floating point literals that you write directly into your source code. `DEF` does not give you literal constants, it's a way more complex system that allows a wide range of Python calculations at parse time, long before types are applied or C code is getting generated. It is based on Python values in a Python namespace. Only when the `DEF`-ed names are used in the \"regular\" source code, Cython's parser will re-insert the Python values by serialising them back and creating syntax nodes based on the Python value type. This works safely for ~strings and~ integers, but specifically for floating point values, we do not guarantee the precision. (Edit: actually, for strings, it also depends on Python's string semantics, e.g. it allows you to mix text and bytes in Py2, for example, and you get in your C code whatever Python type Python made of it.)",
