Please describe.\n\nIn my code, I would like to do [...]\r\n```cython\r\n# add use case related code here\r\n```\r\nI want to make my code from py to pyx,in this way ,I find that work is hard and not pythonlity. I read the paper and some wiki ,have no good idea.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI hope that cython can provide such a new function in the new version to facilitate the rapid conversion from python files to cython code, or reduce the migration work.\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nI have seriously considered this problem. If you can analyze the syntax of python code, and then use the syntax of python to generate code, you can reduce the complexity from python to cython to a certain extent.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
