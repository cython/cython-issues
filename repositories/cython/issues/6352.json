In my particular case, I have private `enum class` and a public alias to it. I wrapped public one with Cython as `enum class` mentioning all enumerators inside it. It fails to compile because Cython adds unneeded `enum` for that alias and that's illegal in C++.\r\n\r\nIf you wonder why I don't have separate wrappers for public and private parts, that's because I generate the whole thing automatically and try to keep it as simple as possible.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cpp\r\nenum class enum_private{\r\n    a, b\r\n};\r\n\r\nusing enum_public = enum_private;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef enum class enum_public:\r\n    a\r\n    b\r\n\r\ncdef enum_public f():\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated signature looks like: `__PYX_ENUM_CLASS_DECL enum_public f()`.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nDon't use `__PYX_ENUM_CLASS_DECL` in C++ mode.\n\n### OS\n\nRHEL 8\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.2\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.0.11\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Not mentioning that this elaborated type specifier is not used for `class`-es, it means that even if there are real cases when Cython actually allows this name hiding, it won't work for `class`-es.\r\n\r\nI used workaround similar to what you suggested, generated full enum wrapper for a private name with an alias for a public one.
