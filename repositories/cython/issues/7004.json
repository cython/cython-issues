Please describe.\n\nconsider the following code\n\n```\ncdef class A:\n\tdef __int__(self):\n\t\treturn 1\n\ncpdef int b(int x):\n\treturn x\n\ncpdef int c(A a):\n\treturn b(a)\n```\n\nthis goes through Python `__Pyx_PyInt_As_int`, even though it is known that the return value always fit in an `int`.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI can see a few possible solutions.\n\n* `cpdef int __int__(self): ...`. This has the disadvantage of not supporting a class that most (but not all) of the time fits into an `int`.\n* `cdef int __cython_cast_int__(self): ...` which will be specially interpreted by Cython when it needs to cast such a class to `int`: I think this works, and the method can raise `OverflowError` etc. when needed.\n    * a disadvantage with this approach: depends on whether the type is statically known, the behavior might be different if this method is not the same as `__int__`. Potential source of bugs.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe practical use case of this is to implement a cast of sage `Integer` class to `ulong` using `mpz_get_ui`, fast track the case where it indeed fits into one.",
