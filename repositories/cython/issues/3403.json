    "body": "With Cython 29.2 (from Debian stable) the statement\r\n```\r\na += b\r\n```\r\nwhere `a` is a Cython memory view is equivalent to\r\n```\r\na = a + b\r\n```\r\ni.e. a new object is created and assigned to the name `a`.  This is different from how augmented arithmetic operations work for Numpy arrays (where the first form modifies `a` in place) and also IMHO from what one would expect.  Is this perhaps because in-place operators are not defined for memoryviews and Python thus falls back to normal operators?\r\n\r\nIf this behavior is by design, I believe it should be documented (I could not find anything).\r\n\r\nThe following script demonstrates the issue.  Note that replacing `a += ...` by `a[:] += ...` is a work-around for the issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Compile with\r\n# cython3 --embed bug.pyx && gcc bug.c -I /usr/include/python3.7/ -lpython3.7m\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n\r\ndef memoryview():\r\n    cdef double[:] tmp = np.zeros(10)\r\n    return tmp\r\n\r\n\r\ndef ndarray():\r\n    tmp = np.zeros(10)\r\n    return tmp\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main(f):\r\n    a = f()\r\n    print(type(a))\r\n    print(id(a))\r\n    a += np.arange(len(a))\r\n    print(id(a))\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main(memoryview)\r\n    main(ndarray)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following output\r\n```\r\n<class 'bug._memoryviewslice'>\r\n140199050152928\r\n140199050328384\r\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\r\n140199073013152\r\n140199073013152\r\n```",
