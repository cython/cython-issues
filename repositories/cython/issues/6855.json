    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nThere seems to be a new issue in Cython 3.1 with the inspectable signatures of functions using fused types: the function shows up to Python's inspect() machinery as though it has parameters like 'signatures', 'args' etc. instead of its real parameters.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\nfrom cython cimport floating  # Fused float, double\n\ndef f1(double arg1):\n    return arg1 * arg1\n\ndef f2(floating arg1):\n    return arg1 * arg1\n```\n\n```\nIn [3]: inspect.signature(test.f1).parameters\nOut[3]: mappingproxy({'arg1': <Parameter \"arg1\">})\n\nIn [4]: inspect.signature(test.f2).parameters\nOut[4]: \nmappingproxy({'signatures': <Parameter \"signatures\">,\n              'args': <Parameter \"args\">,\n              'kwargs': <Parameter \"kwargs\">,\n              'defaults': <Parameter \"defaults\">,\n              '_fused_sigindex_ref': <Parameter \"_fused_sigindex_ref\">})\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nFor both f1 and f2, `inspect.signature()` should show that there is one argument called 'arg1'. This worked when building with Cython 3.0.11.\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.0\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt looks like #6823 & #6848 might be related - I'm guessing there has been a change in how overloaded functions work - but this seemed distinct enough to be a separate issue.\n\nFor overloaded functions more generally it might not be possible to present one signature; it could be presented as a generic `*args, **kwargs` signature (this is still different to the signature currently presented). But where the variation is only in the parameter types, it would be nice to present the actual parameters in the signature.",

I'd probably use git bisect to start investigating this (there's no need to build Cython itself to test anything like this - just run cython.py or cythonize.py directly from the git repo).\n\nWith that said, there's no obligation for you to do any further investigation. I haven't personally had much time to investigate most of the new 3.1 issues this week, but they'll all get looked at fairly soon hopefully.\n",
