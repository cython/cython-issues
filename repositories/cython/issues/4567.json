Making Cython a build dependency is no more a burden with the improvement of packaging of Python in the last decade.\r\n\r\nThis change also follows some general development guidelines like:\r\n* Don't put under VCS any computer generated file\r\n* Distribute pure source code, not semi-compiled code (Debian) \r\n\r\nThe work to be done by modifying the documentation at:\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/docs/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.rst#distributing-cython-modules\r\n",

I doubt that letting Cython run every time a wheel is built is spending less energy than shipping (and locally caching) the compressed C sources would. It's more probably the other way round. What I'm sure actually saves energy (and thus CO2 emissions) is rather spending _more_ space on binary wheels and thus avoiding build time overhead as much as possible.",
