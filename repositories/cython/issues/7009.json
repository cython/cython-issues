This becomes aparent when trying to call the static method from another function.\n\nThe cythonization step runs without errors but compiling the C file fails.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\ncimport cython\n\ncdef class A:\n    @staticmethod\n    cdef foo(cython.integral val):\n        if cython.integral is int:\n            print(\"This is an int\")\n        else:\n            print(\"This is not an int\")\n\ndef bar(cython.integral val):\n    A.foo(val)\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nCython should have generated valid C code containing the definitions of the satatic method\n\n### OS\n\nmacOS\n\n### Python version\n\n3.13.3\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.2\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe bug doesn't manifest itself when changing the static method to a `def`'d method.\n\nThe bug also appears when using memory views of fused types (e.g. `cython.integral[:]`).",

If so how can I help you with that?\n\nThanks for your work on the project!",

Good luck to whoever is going to try and fix it.\n\nIf you don't want to recieve this kind of \"+1\" comments, I'd recommend you to either label the issue or write a short, one sentence long comment that just acknowledges that some human eyeballs have seen the message. I wouldn't have written my comment (and wasted your time) if I knew you saw them. Maybe you could have a \"seen\" label so that you can show you saw the issue in one click without having to triage it?\n\nAnyways, thanks for your work!",
