Same behaviour on Mac and Ubuntu and Cython version is 0.29.16.  I couldn't find anything in the docs that says this would have changed? \r\n",

If you look carefully, if the `isinstance(..., int)` checks fail execution would continue out of the outer `if` statement, and reach the end of the function which returns `None`. You'll probably want to remove the `else:`, and just always return `NotImplemented` if the function reaches the end.",
