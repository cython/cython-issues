It looks like overriding a DEF compile time constant is not possible, which seems, at least to me, to be counterintuitive. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how using a templating language would address this use case.\r\n\r\nWhy not just translate a DEF VARIABLE to:\r\n```c\r\n#ifndef VARIABLE\r\n#define VARIABLE\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nor at least facilitate the idiom I used in my first post?\r\n\r\n",
