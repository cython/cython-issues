It probably has to do with https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Utility/Complex.c#L7, where C11 is being checked, but without also checking for MSVC at the same time. This leads to using MSVC complex types (`_Fcomplex` etc.), for which there's no proper support.\r\n\r\nThe following (untested) diff should probably fix this:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/Cython/Utility/Complex.c b/Cython/Utility/Complex.c\r\nindex a9b851288..85f47c7bf 100644\r\n--- a/Cython/Utility/Complex.c\r\n+++ b/Cython/Utility/Complex.c\r\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@\r\n #if !defined(CYTHON_CCOMPLEX)\r\n   #if defined(__cplusplus)\r\n     #define CYTHON_CCOMPLEX 1\r\n-  #elif (defined(_Complex_I) && !defined(_MSC_VER)) || ((defined (__STDC_VERSION__) && __STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L) && !defined(__STDC_NO_COMPLEX__))\r\n+  #elif (defined(_Complex_I) && !defined(_MSC_VER)) || ((defined (__STDC_VERSION__) && __STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L && !defined(_MSC_VER)) && !defined(__STDC_NO_COMPLEX__))\r\n     // <complex.h> should exist since C99, but only C11 defines a test to detect it.\r\n     // MSVC defines \"_Complex_I\" but not \"_Complex\". See https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5512\r\n     #define CYTHON_CCOMPLEX 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you agree with the solution, I can open a PR!\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nNo compilation failures.\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.11.6\r\n\r\n### Cython version\r\n\r\n3.0.5",
