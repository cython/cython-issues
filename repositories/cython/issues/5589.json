If it is the latter, then perhaps the behavior is unsurprising since Cython's annotation support remains a work in progress. I'd only consider this a bug if it's a regression from 0.29.",

For `Exception` you're almost always using derived classes so it might need to be special-cased. That's a problem for a different PR though~ Ignore this. It doesn't look to be an issue practically.",

Yes, it's a different behavior of Cython at runtime based on the Python version, but runtime Cython behaviors translate to compile-time behaviors for Cython users i.e. packages built using Cython. If you are building a Python package for multiple Python versions and you use type annotations that are only known in some of those, that seems like a code smell. It could be done correctly and safely if the appropriate safeguards are in place such that a particular code path was only taken for supported Python versions, in which case it would be a runtime check that the Cython compiler doesn't know about, but it seems more likely to be an error. These are all warnings, so it's not like they'll prevent the code from compiling. If I've understood the issue correctly, wouldn't warning based on the builtins list at compile-time be a more conservative choice in a good way?",
