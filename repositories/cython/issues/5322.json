Please describe.\n\nI would like to be able to use pycharm navigation to error lines.\r\n\r\nToday pycharm will happily identify full paths in build output, and allow one click navigation to the file and line.  This does not work with cython since the relative path is used.  Tracebacks for errors use fully qualified paths, and cython should here too.  The only downside is that the full path is longer and therefore placing it and the error message on the same line would be excessive.  The suggestion is to put these on separate lines and use full paths.  (Similar to how clang would output a compilation error anyway)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
