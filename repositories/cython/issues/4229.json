    "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nCython allows interfacing to combine c or cpp into a python-like language and produces highly optimized code. This greatly enhances the capability of python. Although the road cpp/c -> cython is well documented,  I would like to explore the reverse too. The documents allow describe that process of creating a header file from cython code, e.g.\r\n\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef public double test(double x):\r\n  return x\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  produces the header with content\r\n  ```\r\n  [...]\r\n__PYX_EXTERN_C double test(double);\r\n```\r\n\r\nGreat! This exposes the function such that it can be used by c/cpp. However for classes it does not expose the methods only the properties. \r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# file: test.pyx\r\ncdef public class Foo[object PyFoo, type PyFoo_t]:\r\n    cdef public double x\r\n    def __init__(self, double x):\r\n      self.x = x\r\n    cdef double test(self, double x):\r\n        return x\r\n```\r\n\r\ngenerates the following parts in the header\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\nstruct PyFoo {\r\n  PyObject_HEAD\r\n  struct __pyx_vtabstruct_4test_Foo *__pyx_vtab;\r\n  double x;\r\n};\r\n\r\n__PYX_EXTERN_C DL_IMPORT(PyTypeObject) PyFoo_t;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI believe the function is not defined but put inside vtab. \r\n\r\n**Is there a way to access the function defined in the extension class directly?**\r\n\r\nThere is a way to explicitly write wrappers like \r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef double foo_test(& Foo foo, double x):\r\n    return foo.test(x)\r\n```\r\nwhich results in a function showing up in the header one could call. However this seems awfully verbose and increases complexity of larger projects. \r\n\r\n# Attempts\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// file test_foo.cpp\r\n#include \"test.h\"\r\nint main() {\r\n  auto x = 3.;\r\n  auto foo = PyFoo();\r\n  foo->__pyx_vtab->test(x);  //errors\r\n  foo->test(x); // errors\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
