We'll quite rapidly find out if it breaks any of Cython's utility code generation (its primary use) since that is covered by the the test-suite.\r\n\r\nA few projects (Pandas, Scipy) do use Tempita from Cython to do some code-generation of Cython code. This is also a use-case that we're keen to support better, so possibly we possibly shouldn't be too brutal removing everything that's unused. I still think it's reasonable to remove these html bits that have been broken for years.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nWith that said, I'm happy to do the removal myself if you'd rather someone else gets the blame for it!\r\n",
