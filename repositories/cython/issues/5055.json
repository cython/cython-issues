    "body": "Cython currently uses `ma_version_tag` as an optimization to cache attribute lookups (i.e. if the dict version hasn't changed then the same attribute will be returned). CPython plans to deprecate `ma_version_tag` (see https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/461#issue-1377051359) since its now longer how they handle the same problem internally, and it'll save space.\r\n\r\nThere's two things Cython can do when this happens:\r\n* turn off caching based on dict versioning (it's behind an guard `CYTHON_USE_DICT_VERSIONS`)\r\n* move to match how CPython now does dict versioning. I think that's a situation where the same version is kept while the *keys* remain the same, so we'd need to cache a link to a stored key-value-pair rather than a value. The advantage of this scheme (for CPython) is that values can be updated in place and the cached lookup remains good (even if the value its looking up has changed).",
