For completeness this was a problem in my setup because I had `which-function-mode` enabled which means that opening a Cython file would hang once my cursor was on such a problematic line.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n```\r\n# test-cython.pyx\r\ncdef void test():\r\n    cdef double my_var\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to the second line of `test-cython.pyx` and `M-:` `(cython-current-defun)` will never finish.\r\n\r\n",
