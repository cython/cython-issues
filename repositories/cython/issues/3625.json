Then the answer is: yes, not entirely easily, but they could. We currently only let that analysis fall out for free at code generation time, but do not have it available when we determine the function type. It would be an improvement in this case.

When you use **Python type annotations**, it would be weird if you lost Python exception propagation semantics along the way, just by compiling the code.\r\n\r\n>> @h-vetinari: Even if those type annotations use cython types (as in the OP)? Could those annotated types not be inspected whether they actually need python?\r\n\r\n> @scoder: I read your question as \"could those annotated functions not be analysed to see if they actually raise exceptions\", is that what you meant?\r\n\r\nI was responding mainly to \"python type annotations\" (my bold), and how the OP used type annotations, but not python ones. But IIUC, you're saying that the (python) types are much less relevant here than the (python) exception behaviour.\r\n\r\nI don't think analysing functions for whether they raise or not is reasonable. But maybe having a way (another decorator?) to indicate that the function *will not* raise (or shouldn't be checked for exceptions) would provide what's desired here?",
