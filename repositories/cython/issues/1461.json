The whole tracing support works by explicitly calling the tracer before the C code that is generated for each line of user code that gets executed, and declarations aren't really considered user code. The trace call would need to get added to the instantiation of class objects and functions. AFAIR, we already trace the user code in the module init function, so this should generally be possible, although some C things might happen in an unexpected order in Cython.\n",

That's because the trace frame and its 'code' object is created for the module init function only at the start, and thus refers to the module. When the execution switches to the include file, the code object is not updated (and I'm not sure that it would be a good idea to do that). That generally applies to all usages of ``include``. It's simply not anticipated in CPython to have a code mix from multiple files in one function.\r\n\r\nDon't know what would be a good way to deal with this. Reporting wrong lines probably isn't ideal anyway.",
