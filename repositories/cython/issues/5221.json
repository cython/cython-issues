    "body": "Sometimes compilation cache step fails to retrieve the previous cache - not for individual platforms but for whole runs\r\n\r\nI am not sure why, my theory is that there are too many caches and since github will delete least recent caches if the total amount of stored cache exids 10 GB, github just deletes the ones that are going to be used\r\nIt still seems suspicious, since total cache size of one CI job is much less than 10 gb\r\n\r\nIf my theory is correct than reducing number and size of caches will help\r\nOne way to attack is to compress cache more, and another is to group caches - closest python versions should be similar enough\r\n\r\nI have not investigated how frequently this happens, but it happend often enough to notice it\r\nIf cache is not retrieved in a significant fraction of runs than it doesn't help and only expands time spent on one job for a little\r\nIn my opinion it's better to have smaller cache hit percentage than not having cache at all sometimes",
