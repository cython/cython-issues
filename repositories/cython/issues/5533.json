Let Cython 3.1 support those CPython versions still under official support -- for everyone else, there's 3.0.\r\n\r\nI say this not least because it would IMO be healthier for the project to not stretch itself too thin with supporting ancient versions. The 5 years that upstream CPython supports a given version should really be enough IMO.",
