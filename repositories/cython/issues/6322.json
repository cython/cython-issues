Wit with release candidate the ABI is frozen which means wheels for Python 3.13 can be build and uploaded to PyPI.\r\n\r\nSince cython is a (very) low-level dependency for many downstream projects, it would be beneficial to have Python 3.13 on PyPI as fast as possible, via a 3.0.x release and/or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\ncibuildwheel now uses the latest Python `3.13.0rc1` and build Python 3.13 by default (https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/1950). Next cibuildwheel release should be soon, which can help this process.",
