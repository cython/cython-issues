The following code:\r\n```cython\r\ncimport cython\r\nfrom cython.parallel import prange\r\n\r\ncdef extern from *:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    class Test {\r\n    };\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    cdef cppclass Test:\r\n        Test() nogil except +\r\n\r\n@cython.cpp_locals(True)\r\ncdef test():\r\n    cdef int i\r\n    for i in prange(10, nogil=True):\r\n        var = Test()\r\n```\r\nuses std::optional<Test> to store the variable, while it uses Test to store the thread local variable. This results in an invalid assignment:\r\n```\r\nCYTHON_UNUSED __Pyx_Optional_Type<Test> __pyx_v_var;\r\n__Pyx_Optional_Type<Test> __pyx_t_3;\r\n...\r\nTest __pyx_parallel_temp1;\r\n...\r\n__pyx_t_3 = Test();\r\n__pyx_v_var = std::move((*__pyx_t_3));\r\n...\r\n__pyx_parallel_temp1 = __pyx_v_var;\r\n```\r\nhere the last assignment to `__pyx_parallel_temp1` is invalid.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe temporary variable `__pyx_parallel_temp1` should use the type `__Pyx_Optional_Type<Test>` as well.",

I think the move is still worth generating for efficiency, but it doesn't let you couldn't already do.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nEdit: From microsoft: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/parallel/openmp/2-directives?view=msvc-160#2723-lastprivate\r\n\r\n> A variable with a class type that's specified as lastprivate must have an accessible, unambiguous copy assignment operator.\r\n\r\nso I really don't think you can such a class directly inside a Cython parallel loop. If you don't use it after the loop (so Cython's `lastprivate` clause is unnecessary) then it'd probably work to wrap the loop body in a cdef function and call the cdef function in the loop",
