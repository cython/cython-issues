Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release?

Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen Cythonizing a `class` that contains an `async` method, it appears `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` returns `False`. If the same `class` were not Cythonized, passing the `async` method to `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` returns `True`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nimport inspect\r\n\r\n\r\nclass C:\r\n    async def m(self):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n\r\nassert inspect.iscoroutinefunction(C.m)  # <--- Fails when Cythonized. Passes in pure Python\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`inspect.iscoroutinefunction` having the same result whether the `class` is Cythonized or not.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS\r\n - Python version: 3.8.8\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.23\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNA",
