I'm fairly sure this is unnecessary. The \"wrapper\" functions are correct though with \r\n\r\n```c\r\n__Pyx_RefNannySetupContext(\"__del__ (wrapper)\", 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nclass C:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        pass\r\n    def __del__(self):\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nNot trying to acquire the GIL\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.11\r\n\r\n### Cython version\r\n\r\nCurrent master https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/19f67cb1f4ab66b87b1bdfc881bb875faed8c1a3\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis is fairly low priority in that refnanny is only really a testing tool, and the code generated still works. It does appear to affect a free-threading bug (https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6214#issuecomment-2132292912) but I think that's mainly a Python bug and you could hit it in other ways.",
