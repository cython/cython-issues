Generally `import *` tries to overwrite C variables (on the basis that if the module defined `Py_SSIZE_T_MAX` then you'd expect it to be updated). This generates invalid code since `Py_SSIZE_T_MAX` isn't actually writeable.\r\n\r\nThis really shouldn't happen for things defined in utility code and maybe should be more limited generally. For example maybe the extern variable should be declared const and thus not be replaceable..",
