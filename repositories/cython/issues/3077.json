    "body": "A common use case when extending Numba is to use an existing Cython extension module to provide access points to the compiled functions contained within. For Numba to do this the `__pyx_capi__` attribute must be queried. Examples and discussion here: https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3086 and API guide here http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/extending/high-level.html#importing-cython-functions.\r\n\r\nRecently work has started on `numba-scipy` to add SciPy support to Numba, this PR https://github.com/numba/numba-scipy/pull/12 notes that `__pyx_capi__` is a Cython internal.\r\n\r\nThe crux of all this is I think a few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is `__pyx_capi__` sufficiently ingrained in Cython that it can be relied upon being present indefinitely.\r\n2. Is `__pyx_capi__` truly internal? Or are there cases in practice where users are parsing/using it ([pythran does already?!](https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Third%20Party%20Libraries.html))?\r\n3. Is the form of `__pyx_capi__` stable/consistent.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
