    "body": "I am writing a `cdef class` whose attributes need to be deallocated in a specific order. It would be very helpful if you could help answer the following questions (even if the answer is just \"that's not defined!\" ðŸ˜„)\r\n\r\n* When an instance of a `cdef class` is deallocated, are its attributes destroyed/finalized in a specific order?\r\n* When is `__dealloc__` called in relation to attribute destruction? (before or after?)\r\n\r\nIn the example below, I wrote a `cdef class Baz` with two C++ attributes and two Python attributes. These were my observations about its destruction behaviour:\r\n\r\n1. First, the `__dealloc__` method of the cdef class is invoked.\r\n2. Next, any destructors of C++ attributes are (manually) invoked _in the order they are declared_.\r\n3. Next, `Py_CLEAR()` is invoked on Python attributes _in the order they are declared_.\r\n\r\nDoes the above sound accurate? Is any of this behaviour guaranteed by Cython?\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n# foo.pyx\r\n\r\ncdef extern from *:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    #include <iostream>\r\n    #include <string>\r\n\r\n    class Foo {\r\n       public:\r\n        Foo() = default;\r\n        Foo(std::string name): name(name){}\r\n        ~Foo() {\r\n            std::cout << name << std::endl;\r\n         }\r\n       private:\r\n         std::string name;\r\n    };\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    cdef cppclass Foo:\r\n        Foo() except +\r\n        Foo(string name) except +\r\n\r\nclass Bar:\r\n    def __init__(self, name):\r\n        self.name = name\r\n\r\n    def __del__(self):\r\n        print(self.name)\r\n\r\ncdef class Baz:\r\n    cdef object one\r\n    cdef Foo two\r\n    cdef object three\r\n    cdef Foo four\r\n\r\n    def __cinit__(self):\r\n        self.one = Bar(\"one\")\r\n        self.two = Foo(\"two\")\r\n        self.three = Bar(\"three\")\r\n        self.four = Foo(\"four\")\r\n\r\n    def __dealloc__(self):\r\n        print(\"__dealloc__\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: from foo import Baz\r\n\r\nIn [2]: x = Baz()\r\ntwo\r\nfour\r\nfour\r\n\r\nIn [3]: del x\r\n__dealloc__\r\ntwo\r\nfour\r\none\r\nthree\r\n```",

Python objects can end up cleared early by the GC if they form reference cycles so you shouldn't rely on them being available in `__dealloc__` (see http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html#disabling-cycle-breaking-tp-clear). C++ objects in order of definition sounds plausible (it looks like they come from `scope.var_entries` which is a list so should preserve order of insertion) from an implementation point of but I wouldn't rely on it - if you care about the order then you should be enforcing it manually.",
