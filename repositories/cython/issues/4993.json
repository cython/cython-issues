The whole feature is designed around helping deal with multiple exceptions being raised concurrently[^1] within a given block of code (e.g. several threads, or async, or ...).\r\n\r\nTo correctly reflect this, there needs to be something exception-like - i.e. can be caught/handled/rethrown - that can hold multiple individual exceptions (trio originally called this MultiError, cpython now chose ExceptionGroup), and the whole `try:/except:` game now needs to be able to deal with these containers, with some new additional operations (mainly filtering) due to now having (potentially) several different exceptions in one group.\r\n\r\nIn order not to break existing code through subtly different exception semantics between single exceptions and ExceptionGroups, this needed new syntax (`except*`) to distinguish intent[^2]. There's more details regarding serialization, stacks, tracing, etc., but that's it.\r\n\r\n[^1]: obviously those exceptions will not happen at the exact same instant in time, but from the point of view of the parent thread/nursery, when all the threads return control, several exceptions might have happened.\r\n\r\n[^2]: If `except SomeException` had been empowered to filter `SomeException` out of `ExceptionGroup`s that contain one, there could be cases that behave differently than before.",
