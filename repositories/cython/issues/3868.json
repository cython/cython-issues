Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. In my code, I would like to do [...]\r\n```console\r\n$ python3.9 -m pip install cython\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like this to be super fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen, including code examples if applicable.\r\n\r\nI'd like pip to install Cython wheels with Python 3.9.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIt is possible to install Cython with `--install-option=\"--no-cython-compile\"`, but that doesn't work in situations where Cython is a dependency.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the feature request here.\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.0 final was released this week: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/\r\n\r\nThank You.",
