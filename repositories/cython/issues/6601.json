Please describe.\n\nIn trivial cases that \"obviously\" don't access the caught exception, we can avoid getting and normalising it completely. We already do this for `except â€¦: pass`, but we could do it in a few other cases as well, e.g.\r\n```cython\r\ntry:\r\n    return values[1]\r\nexcept IndexError:\r\n    return None  # definitely discarding the exception unseen\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nWe currently only check for an empty statement list in the `except` clause, although that's not guaranteed to be empty even for a `pass` statement.\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/4201ff0b97058b8cdf607f458226b0b939e0712d/Cython/Compiler/Nodes.py#L8484-L8486\r\nWe should use a more general check here.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
