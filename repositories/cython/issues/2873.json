Depending on how long the working directory path is, there might be a lot to mentally ignore before the path becomes interesting.\r\n\r\nIt seems more of a bug that relative paths don't work well for (some) editors. They should. I think it's rather something to fix in those editors.\r\n\r\nOTOH, maybe we could use relative paths when the output goes to a terminal window and absolute paths when sending it to a pipe?
