I cannot say if that's something users would commonly do, but it's definitely not something that I'd rule out.\n\nI'm not convinced that an implicit assignment from `long` to `bint` has clear enough semantics to turn it into `0 or 1`. Users should generally be aware of C integer ranges and take care of them. `bint` is [documented](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#types) as \"`int` with 0/non-0 values for False/True\", i.e. it's not a bit, it's a C `int`.

In C++ `bool` type is defined as [1]:\n\n> integer type, capable of holding one of the two values: true or false.\n\nAnd truly, in C++ the behaviour of following snippet:\n\n```c++\n    unsigned long long a = 4294967296L;\n    bool b = a;\n```\nwill produce `1` in `b` variable.

Cython's `bint` semantics only enter the game when coercing between C and Python values. Up to that point, it's a simple C `int`. And in the other direction, Python object to C `bint`, it accepts an arbitrary Python object, reads its truthiness value, and stores it as a simple 0/1 C `int` value.\n\nChanging the C semantics to always assign `0` or `1` also from C is a behavioural change. It could certainly be argued that code that passes non-0/1 values through a `bint` and relies on the exact value on the other end might not be using an appropriate C type, but it's documented that way and I don't know how much existing user code relies on it.\n\nWhat do you think about (somewhat contrived) code like this, for example:\n```cython\ndef any(values) -> bool:\n    cdef bint result = False\n    for value in values:\n        if condition(value):\n            result += 1\n    return result\n```\nI don't think mixing C integer and boolean semantics in a single data type is wrong per se.",

            "body": "Having this unorthodox bint type that magically turns truths into falsehoods if you add just the right number of truths to it (but won't necessarily become false after subtracting a truth), seems very odd. It is also magic in size being not register sized like a [64-bit] C++ bool nor 1 bit. Not to mention bitwise operations are weird, if(&lt;bint&gt;2 & &lt;bint&gt;1) { nope } and the English word bint being problematic slang.\n\nAlso if the bool in vector[bool] comes from cython's libcpp (which is bint), the vector will miss out on standard [specialisation](https://www.en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector_bool.html).\n\nIf Cython is a Python to C/C++ compiler, then Python behaviour is expected default (True + True == 2). This is different to C++ (true + true == true). It is different to C89 (no bool). It is also different to the current bint at the integer limit. So, arithmetic and bitwise ops on bool in Cython would need to coerce into Python integer type by default to be correct. Perhaps there could be a new distutil switch to prefer previous behaviour, correct behaviour, or optimised C++ style boolean arithmetic. Something like CYTHON_BOOLEAN_ARITHMETIC = LEGACY/PYTHONIC/BOOLEAN.\n\nFor C++, could adopt the standard bool as the builtin bool in cython, and deprecate bint. Fixes vector. Then with BOOLEAN behaviour, C++ already coerces everything to 0 or 1. With PYTHONIC behaviour, arithmetic gets done in Python integers.\n\nFor C, could adopt bint as the builtin bool in cython with sensible [C23](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/conversion.html#Boolean_conversion)-style assignments. Then with BOOLEAN behaviour, coerce everything to 0 or 1 like C++ does. With PYTHONIC behaviour, arithmetic gets coerced into Python integers anyway so the integer wraparound is avoided.\n\nIt is probably a bad idea now that I've thought about it ðŸ˜‰\n\n",
