What I think is happening here is:\n* the closing `}` of an f-string expression can't be matched until the number of other brackets is balanced.\n* if we don't think we've closed the f-string expression then we aren't looking for the end of the string - we're still looking for `}`.\n* we then reach the end of the line without ever seeing the end of the string.\n\nIn this case there might be an easy way out though, because I don't think the number of brackets should ever go \"negative\" (i.e. it shouldn't be possible to have more closing brackets than opening brackets) so there might be an opportunity to catch this early.",
