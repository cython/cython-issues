Please describe.\r\n\r\nBuilding a package, that relies on Cython it would be nice to have a pre-built wheel for macosx with the arm64 architecture instead of only x84_64.\r\n\r\nI faced the issue when building a Cython module in my CI for multiple systems including macOS with arm64 and x84_64, where the CI cant build properly because it gets the x84_64 wheel for Cython, and therefore builds another wheel for x84_64 of my package. However it should build for arm64.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that this can be resolved by adding a prebuilt Cython wheel for arm64, since I found similar issues on scipy that were resolved when this wheel was included in the releases.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nHowever if you think this issue is not relevant to Cython please feel free to close the issue.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThis issue is edited to reflect the problem better.",
