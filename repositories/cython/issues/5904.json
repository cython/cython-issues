However it should build for arm64.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that this can be resolved by adding a prebuilt Cython wheel for arm64, since I found similar issues on scipy that were resolved when this wheel was included in the releases.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nHowever if you think this issue is not relevant to Cython please feel free to close the issue.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThis issue is edited to reflect the problem better.",
