Some [compatible formats for Neovim](https://neovim.io/doc/user/editing.html#gF) would be:\n\n```c\n// \"source_file.pyx\" 2 (remove colon `:`)\n// source_file.pyx:2   (Remove quotes. This would follow the output from `grep -n`)\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nRemove the quotes manually.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I thought of two ways to transition the change:\n\n1. Create a CLI option that permits us to choose the format and put it in a minor release. Personally, I find this unnecessary.\n2. Consider it a breaking change and save it for a major release.",
