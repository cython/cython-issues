We could also add an option to the test runner to list the tests matching a tag. Tagging tests seems better than trying to fit them into a single context.\r\n\r\n> See if transitioning to use pytest instead of a custom script is viable\r\n\r\nI already talked to a pytest dev about this a couple of years ago. The major problem here is that pytest has a test discovery phase and a test run phase, whereas for Cython's test modules have two test phases, it's module discovery, compilation test, module test discovery, module test. That's difficult to fit into existing test runners.\r\n\r\n> Cleanup foo_bugs.txt\r\n\r\nHelp is welcome. They can be selectively enabled in the test runner to see if/how they fail.\r\n\r\n> docs/ and Doc/\r\n\r\nThere's almost nothing left in `Doc`, but `docs` is processed by Sphinx. If we move the rest over, it needs to be excluded, which seems weird. Why move it into the same directory just to exclude it afterwards?\r\n\r\n> scripts in the root directory may be redundant with scripts in the bin/ directory\r\n\r\nTo some extent. Not sure if it's worth merging them. There's almost no code in them.\r\n\r\n> things like Cython/Parser/Grammar that are explicitly unused\r\n\r\n\"explicitly unused\" is a bit of a big word. You can use the grammar, it just won't work currently. :)\r\n\r\n> document what tests/broken/ is\r\n\r\nIt's the directory that we moved Pyrex tests into during the split if they made little sense in Cython's test runner. Pyrex' test suite was based on C file comparison, which was no longer feasible with the change rate in Cython's code base. Most of these tests just lack actual … tests. Still, it seems worth looking through them to see if our test suite is lacking something now. It quite probably is.",

Is that a hung CI run or should the run be parallelized somehow?
