You should only resort to Cython specific constructs for use use cases where there's no other way. And whether there's no other way may also change in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n> > ```\r\n> > a = \"global value\"\r\n> > def foo():\r\n> >   IF condition:\r\n> >     a = \"local value\"\r\n> >   print(a)\r\n> > ```\r\n> \r\n> Does it change if you use cython or pure python?\r\n\r\nYes. Cython evaluates the condition before looking at the declarations. If `condition` is true, `a` will become a local variable through the assignment. Otherwise, it will be the global variable. If the condition is evaluated at runtime (and, thus, in Python), it would always be the local variable.",
