Please describe.\n\nDue to its complex feature set, the memoryview implementation is actually quite large, and can add a substantial amount of code (and extension module size) especially to small modules.\r\n\r\nOne idea is to [extract shareable code into a common library](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2356), but that mostly helps in larger projects. For smaller libraries, tightening the feature set might help.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nIf memoryviews are returned from Python functions, they need to provide the full memoryview feature set to Python code, but it's probably not uncommon that memoryviews are only used as a module internal tool. In this case, we can determine the parts of the feature set that are used by the module, and exclude the others.\r\n\r\nCandidates are:\r\n- slice assignments and broadcasting\r\n- the `array` implementation\r\n- â€¦ others?\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

But those cases are probably fairly rare.",
