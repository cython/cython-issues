It's largely targeted at implementations like PyPy where borrowed references confuse their C API implementation, and it tries to be fairly thorough.\r\n* `CYTHON_AVOID_BORROWED_REFS == 2` is targeted at the nogil build and only avoids borrowed references where there's a danger than objects might be on multiple threads.",

Something like \"avoid long borrowed refs\" or \"avoid unique borrowed refs\" might catch the idea of not keeping borrowed refs around for too long, and of not even keeping borrowed refs of things that we control.\n\nIt's worth trying out to see if this has a practical advantage, though. The two PyPy specific feature flags ended up going hand in hand almost all of the time, so there wasn't really a good reason to keep them after I had introduced them everywhere. They're still there.\n",
