Please describe.\r\n\r\nIn my Python code, I would like to do the equivalent of\r\n```cython\r\ncdef const int x = 0\r\ncdef const int[:] mv\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nx: cython.const(cython.int) = 0\r\nx: cython.volatile(cython.int) = 0\r\nmv: cython.const(cython.int)[:]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is invalid annotation syntax since [calls are not allowed](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/annotations.html#type-and-annotation-expressions) there.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nx: cython.const[cython.int] = 0  # possibly a bit too overloaded by now\r\nmv: cython.const[int[:]]  # probably difficult to remember if it's that or cython.const[int][:]\r\nx: cython.int[cython.const] = 0  # difficult to distinguish from (and to mix with) memory views\r\nx: cython.int(cython.const) = 0  # we don't have anything like this yet\r\n\r\nwith cython.const:  # doesn't work for function arguments\r\n    x: cython.int = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [`Annotate[]` typing syntax](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/qualifiers.html#annotated) is fairly verbose and only available in Python 3.9 and later:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom typing import Annotated\r\nx: Annotated[cython.int, cython.const] = 0\r\ny: Annotated[cython.int, cython.volatile] = 1\r\nz: Annotated[cython.int[:], cython.const] = 1\r\n```\r\nFor memory views, it's not obvious whether `Annotated[cython.int[:], cython.const]` really means the commonly used `(const int)[:]` or `const (int[:])` (as it's written). In general, `Annotated[]` is less suitable for any annotations e.g. on struct fields or any other structured usage.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThere's the general problem with memory views that we'll add two levels of declarations, `const()` and `[:]`, which should better be used in a specific order. It's a difference whether you write `cython.const(cython.int)[:]` or `cython.const(cython.int[:])` (in the latter case, the variable cannot be modified, in the first, it's only the items of the memory view).\r\n\r\nWe could argue that `const (int[:])` isn't very useful in comparison to `(const int)[:]` and live without a Python expression for the first. In fact, Cython already transforms `const int[:]` into `(const int)[:]` internally, for this very reason.\r\n\r\nHowever, transforming the \"obvious\" expression `const[int[:]]` into `const[int][:]` automatically means that we cannot support `const (int[:])` in the future any more.",
