What is your \"desired place\" ? Is that inside or outside of your project tree? Are you asking for a dedicated build directory or something else? Did you run \"setup.py --help\" to find out the available options? Does \"setup.py build_ext -i\" do what you want, or do you want something else? That's not clear to me from what you write.",
