    "body": "I want to discuss on the support for [the alias template](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type_alias), which was added to C++11.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the type alias (`using identifier = type_id`) is supported using the `ctypedef type_id identiffier` syntax, thanks to the semantic similarity between the two (one source I can find is subsection 2.1, proposal [n1489](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2003/n1489.pdf)).  [C++ attributes](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes) is not supported but it doesn't seem to have any meaning in Cython context anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing is an equivalent declaration for C++11's\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <template_parameter_list>\r\nusing identifier = type_id; \r\n```\r\nwhich I propose to be `ctypedef type_id = identifier[template_parameter_list]` for consistency with the current C++ class and function template which are currently supported by Cython at the moment.  For example, in `<type_traits>`,\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <class T>\r\nusing remove_reference_t = typename remove_reference<T>::type;\r\n```\r\ncould be written in Cython as `ctypedef remove_reference[T].type remove_reference_t[T]`.\r\n\r\nI am unsure how this can be achieved.\r\n\r\nThis issue might be a part of #2130.\r\n\r\nEdit: for extern declaration, would the following be sufficient?\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from '<type_traits>' namespace 'std' nogil:\r\n    cdef cppclass remove_reference_t[T]:\r\n        pass\r\n```",
