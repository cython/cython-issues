Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThere's a bunch of existing Cython->C++ conversions possible (mainly for container types). It'd be good to have a similar automatic conversion to `std::function`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n It would require creating a reference counted \"object holder\" with an `operator()` defined to match the function type. It could apply to both generic Python callables and bound cdef functions (unbound cdef functions are just a function pointer so don't need special treatment)\r\n\r\nA bit of thought needs to go into how to deal with Python exceptions. One option would be to use an exception specification in the function type, for example `function[int (double) except -1]` might return -1  to C++ if an exception was raised, while `function[int (double) except +]` would convert the Python exceptions to C++ ones.. However, this is diverging slightly from Cython's usual treatment of exceptions since it's going in the opposite direction, and might involve clearing the Python error indicator for example.\r\n\r\nThe GIL is also a fairly large complication - should the wrapper function claim the GIL, should it assume that C++ holds the GIL, etc.? And how should this be controlled in a syntax that matches what Cython does already.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nStatus quo, a ctypes-like approach using runtime code generation (goes beyond what can be done in standard C/C++)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI don't think there's an easy way to support a similar feature in C.\r\nA reference-counted Python object wrapper for C++ goes a bit beyond what Cython usually provides, but since it'll be type-erased by the `std::function` I don't think it's a huge expansion of scope.\r\nAssuming no objections, I'll have a go at the this myself at some point (but probably not immediately)",
