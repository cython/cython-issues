            "body": "**Update:** Sorry, I didn't see there's a bullet point a bit down the page describing how to do what I identify below. For reference, it's the sentence starting with \"Python annotations can be used to declare argument types\", for anyone finding this page as I did and looking for help.\r\n\r\nI do still wonder whether it's possible to annotate in a way that both CPython and Cython could run the same code, e.g., some command-line switch to cython telling it to interpret Python `int` types as `cython.int`, so that one could get the benefits of fixed-width `int`s without needing to make the code incompatible with CPython.\r\n\r\n@scoder @da-woods \r\n\r\nI echo the confusion of @anentropic and @anthrotype.\r\n\r\nOn this page: http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html#static-typing, I don't see any examples using Python type hints that use the syntax of [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/). Instead, that page explains how to take Python code that is not annotated with type hints in the syntax of [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/), and add a `.pxd` file supplying types in Cython syntax.\r\n\r\nBut all of the pure Python code on that page is unannotated with Python types, instead looking like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef myfunction(x, y=2):\r\n    a = x - y\r\n    return a + x * y\r\n\r\ndef _helper(a):\r\n    return a + 1\r\n\r\nclass A:\r\n    def __init__(self, b=0):\r\n        self.a = 3\r\n        self.b = b\r\n\r\n    def foo(self, x):\r\n        print(x + _helper(1.0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas type hints using [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) would look like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef myfunction(x: int, y: int = 2) -> int:\r\n    a: int = x - y\r\n    return a + x * y\r\n\r\ndef _helper(a: float) -> float:\r\n    return a + 1\r\n\r\nclass A:\r\n    def __init__(self, b: int = 0):\r\n        self.a = 3\r\n        self.b = b\r\n\r\n    def foo(self, x):\r\n        print(x + _helper(1.0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use Python type hints, using the standard Python type hints syntax, without the need to manually generate a separate `.pxd` file with Cython-syntax type hints? If so, is there a page that describes how to do that?",

            "body": "Probably a bit late to the discussion, but i'm trying to work out a way to properly work with typings and Cython as well. I've got a rather large library that is written in Cython entirely and should do the following:\r\n\r\n* provide Python 3 typing annotations, so that e.g. mypy can ensure type compatibility when used\r\n* allow Cython to properly know the types of specific function arguments to optimize speed etc\r\n* don't write doubled code if possible\r\n* type-check function arguments for cpdef methods at runtime in cases where mypy isn't used \r\n\r\nTo be honest, i'm not entirely sure where to start:\r\n\r\n* can typings and Cython type annotations be mixed / can one of both be dropped so that I don't need to double things? e.g. can code like this work in a pxd/pyx:\r\n\r\n        cdef class foo:\r\n\r\n          cpdef bar(baz: int) -> None\r\n\r\n* Will it understand all the stuff imported from typings? I guess Optional theoretically isn't needed since Cython accepts None as arguments too by default.\r\n* Will mypy automatically be able to derive typings when used, or do I still need to create pyi files? Or would there be a way to automatically generate pyi files from my Cython modules somehow?\r\n* Can I add type-checking at runtime somehow? I thought about using a module like [typecheck-decorator](https://pypi.org/project/typecheck-decorator/)\r\n\r\nJust my thought processes though. I didn't find a go-to solution for me yet. For now, i'm using Cython type annotations within my code and write dedicated pyi files as a workaround, but it feels rather error-prone since i'm unable to test my pyi files for now and type-checks need to be done manually within every method, and i've got alot of them.\r\nDeffinitely not a Cython issue per-se, but probably an interesting topic to think and discuss about.",
