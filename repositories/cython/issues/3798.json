Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have support for a generic builtin `memoryview`. This can come in handy when the type and dimensionality of the `memoryview` are unknown. In these cases it's tricky to use the Cython `memoryview` as we don't have enough information to type it correctly (or maybe there are tricks I don't know?). The benefit being (much like other builtin types) Cython can translate operations on the `memoryview` into more efficient Python C API calls.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nHere's some sample code showing how this might be used.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ndef nbytes(memoryview m):\r\n    cdef Py_ssize_t i, n = m.itemsize\r\n    for i in range(m.ndim):\r\n        n *= m.shape[i]\r\n    return n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIf one knows the type and dimensionality, a Cython `memoryview` can be used. However this doesn't cover the case discussed above (unless I'm missing something). Another alternative is to use the Python C API directly (though this may be less pleasant for other readers and could be buggy if not carefully used).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNA",

Can't find it right now, but it might be worth basing the changes on that.",
