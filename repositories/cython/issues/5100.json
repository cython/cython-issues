            "body": "I'm not completely sure (because the build system is a bit of a mystery) but I think the cythonize command only really handles the conversion of .pyx/.py files into .c files. Actually invoking the C compiler is left to distutils/setuptools and Cython doesn't really have much control of it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think that `nthreads` only parallelizes running Cython and not the C build. That isn't necessarily hugely helpful because the C build is usually the slower bit.",
