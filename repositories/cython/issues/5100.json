Actually invoking the C compiler is left to distutils/setuptools and Cython doesn't really have much control of it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think that `nthreads` only parallelizes running Cython and not the C build. That isn't necessarily hugely helpful because the C build is usually the slower bit.",

Thus, Cython doesn't have any control over the build parallelisation of `distutils` (nor `setuptools`).\r\n\r\nIn your case, it seems to be within the responsibility of `poetry` to make the extension build run efficiently in parallel.\r\n\r\nIt does seem annoying that you *additionally* have to tell Cython to also parallelise the C code generation. OTOH, `setuptools` has some support also for building Cython extensions directly, without calling `cythonize()` first. That seems an appropriate place to provide parallel calls into both Cython *and* the C compiler. If you call `cythonize()` yourself (which seems reasonable, given the amount of configuration that you pass into it), then I think it's also acceptable to call explicitly for parallel processing.\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue since I don't see much that Cython could do better here (at least at the moment).",
