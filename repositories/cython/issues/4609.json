The repro is as easy as:\r\n```\r\nimport mod\r\n\r\ndef cyfunc(arg):\r\n    mod.function(arg)    \r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `mod.py`:\r\n```\r\nmod_global = \"something\"\r\ndef function(arg, mod_global=None):\r\n     if mod_global is None:  # probably not necessary\r\n         mod_global = arg\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a functioning reproducer at:  https://github.com/seberg/bpo46451 importing `bpo46451` will run the function and tracing will start printing `None` instead of the correct `\"this is a mod global\"`.\r\n\r\nI suspect this happens here: https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Utility/ObjectHandling.c#L2569-L2611",
