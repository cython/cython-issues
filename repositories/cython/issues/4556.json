Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nSince conditional compilation `DEF` & `IF` are not recommended to be used, and will also lead to being unable to distribute a pre-generated C source file properly (As they are evaluated at generation time), I tried to define platform specific methods using a standard Python `if` (Yes, it is possible to do that in plain Python, a class body is actually like a specialized function body). Sadly that doesn't work and the method is defined regardless.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\n# cython: language_level=3str\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\n\r\nNOPE = False\r\n\r\n\r\ncdef class A:\r\n    if NOPE:\r\n        def spam(self):\r\n            print(\"SPAM SPAM SPAM\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import sample\r\n>>> a=sample.A()\r\n>>> a.spam()\r\nSPAM SPAM SPAM\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe method to not be defined.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL\r\n - Python version 3.10.1\r\n - Cython version 0.29.26\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTried to do that here https://github.com/segevfiner/cypcap/pull/25/files\r\n",

            "body": "I don't know that this is hugely easy to do with the way Cython currently handles cdef classes - they're built from statically allocated structures that define what functions they have. It probably isn't completely impossible, but it'd be a fairly significant change. I think this is a reasonable limitation for cdef classes - they're clearly more restrictive than Python classes and those restrictions let us define things at a lower level.\r\n\r\nAlternative options to look at would be:\r\n* Always define the function but raise `NotImplementedError` if it isn't supported.\r\n* Inheritance - you can inherit a Python class from a cdef class, or a cdef class from a Python class (provided that the first base class is a cdef class). You might be able to define the methods in a cdef class.\r\n\r\nGiven that we don't support this, your example should probably produce an error message rather than \"work\" silently.",
