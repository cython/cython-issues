Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nSince conditional compilation `DEF` & `IF` are not recommended to be used, and will also lead to being unable to distribute a per-generated C source file properly (As they are evaluated at generation time), I tried to define platform specific methods using a standard Python `if` (Yes, it is possible to do that in plain Python, a class body is actually like a specialized function body). Sadly that doesn't work and the method is defined regardless.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\n# cython: language_level=3str\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\n\r\nNOPE = False\r\n\r\n\r\ncdef class A:\r\n    if NOPE:\r\n        def spam(self):\r\n            print(\"SPAM SPAM SPAM\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import sample\r\n>>> a=sample.A()\r\n>>> a.spam()\r\nSPAM SPAM SPAM\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe method to not be defined.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL\r\n - Python version 3.10.1\r\n - Cython version 0.29.26\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTried to do that here https://github.com/segevfiner/cypcap/pull/25/files\r\n",
