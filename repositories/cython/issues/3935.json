Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen using pure Python mode to performing nested attribute access, which may go through a couple Cython extension types, it appears that Cython does not recognize C-level attribute access is possible on subsequent layers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nfrom cython import cclass, double\r\n\r\n\r\n@cclass\r\nclass A:\r\n    _b: \"B\"\r\n    \r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self._b = B()\r\n\r\n\r\n@cclass\r\nclass B:\r\n    _c: double\r\n\r\n\r\ndef func(c: double) -> A:\r\n    a: A = A()\r\n    a._b._c = c  # runtime error here\r\n    return a\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIdeally the line `a._b._c = c` would translate into something like `a->_b->_c = c`. However it appears it translates to `a->_b` followed by performing Python object attribute access to get `_c`, which fails since `_c` is not accessible from Python.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS\r\n - Python version: 3.8.6\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.21\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNA",
