    "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nI would like for `cpdef` functions that accept fused types to be able to be documented with Sphinx. Currently, the metadata embedded in fused functions is not suitable for Sphinx and winds up with something like `f(signatures, args, kwargs, defaults, _fused_sigindex={})`. An example is [here](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/nightly/user_guide/api_docs/pylibcudf/binaryop/#pylibcudf.binaryop.binary_operation), corresponding to [this Cython definition](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/blob/branch-24.12/python/pylibcudf/pylibcudf/binaryop.pyx#L20). I am happy to put together an MWE if that would be helpful, but a quick inspection of the object is pretty indicative of where things are going wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import pylibcudf\r\n>>> pylibcudf.binaryop.binary_operation.func_doc\r\n'binary_operation(signatures, args, kwargs, defaults, _fused_sigindex={})\\nPerform a binary operation between a column and another column or scalar.\\n\\n    ``lhs`` and ``rhs`` may be a\\n    :py:class:`~pylibcudf.column.Column` or a\\n    :py:class:`~pylibcudf.scalar.Scalar`, but at least one must be a\\n    :py:class:`~pylibcudf.column.Column`.\\n\\n    For details, see :cpp:func:`binary_operation`.\\n\\n    Parameters\\n    ----------\\n    lhs : Union[Column, Scalar]\\n        The left hand side argument.\\n    rhs : Union[Column, Scalar]\\n        The right hand side argument.\\n    op : BinaryOperator\\n        The operation to perform.\\n    output_type : DataType\\n        The data type to use for the output.\\n\\n    Returns\\n    -------\\n    pylibcudf.Column\\n        The result of the binary operation\\n    '\r\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nThe documentation written to the fused function should output something using standard Python notation (perhaps PEP 484-style type hints) for functions accepting fused types.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
