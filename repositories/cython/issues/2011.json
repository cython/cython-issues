Since most of this can be automated, there should be a tool for it.\r\n\r\nA part of this is already implemented in the form of the [cython_freeze](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.27.3/bin/cython_freeze) tool and the [BuildExecutable](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.27.3/Cython/Build/BuildExecutable.py) helper. Stitching it together into an easy to use \"here's my code, drop the binary here\" tool should not be all too difficult. Also take a look at [Nuitka](https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka), which reportedly has a good way of dealing with this.\r\n\r\nAlso see #2849 regarding the integration of `cython_freeze` into `cython --embed`.",

As far as I know, there isn't such a thing as a package-aware c extension in python, so if you're, for example, running `cython_freeze` over the codebase of an application that contains multiple packages you need to include a step where you flatten that namespace. This isn't too hard to do in codebases that don't do much in `__init__.py` files for example, but is much more difficult to guarantee in the general case.\r\n\r\n2. Related to the above, it's difficult to account for third-party dependencies. They still need, in general, to be shipped alongside the executable. Py2exe has an extension that allows for python to load dynamic libs from a zipfile, and also the capability to pack that up into a single executable, I'm not aware of a working way to do that on systems other than windows.",

If it's possible to create a Python C extension that is seen as a package while being built into the interpreter I'd be glad to put in work getting that into Cython.\r\n\r\nIn PEP489, I read that a compiled module `pack.mod.sub` should be in `pack/mod/sub.so` with an initialization function `PyInit_sub`. When embedding modules, we want them to become 'built-in' modules, which we achieve through `PyImport_ExtendInittab` (as done in `cython_freeze`).\r\n\r\nThis is where @jdodds is not entirely correct, as these built-in modules need not live at the toplevel (they can form a hierarchy). However, when using the default initialization function names (`PyInit_<modulename>`), there will be a naming collision between the initialization functions of `pack.mod.sub` and `other.sub`. Both functions will be named `PyInit_sub`.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to solve this without really breaking anything. For this, we need `Cython/Compiler/ModuleNode.py:mod_init_func_cname` to output the `api_name` instead when aiming for built-in modules. The `inittab` should then simply refer to these `PyInit_<api_name>` functions instead. The point is that we can use any function name we want in the `inittab` and this should somehow become unique for every module.\r\n\r\nWhat is left, then, is to decide how to expose this functionality. With `--embed-modules=` of #2849, we can use `PyInit_<api_name>`, bun this means that we can only link to libraries built specifically for this purpose. Maybe something like `cython --built-in pack/mod/sub.py` should generate code with the API-name as the name of the initialization function.",
