It would be better to be able to do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor x in prange(..., gil=True):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nand having it call `PyGILState_Ensure()` or similar only once per loop.\r\n\r\nA few open questions:\r\n* the syntax,\r\n* what to do on non-freethreading builds? Fail? Compile with warning? Compile but drop the GIL at least once per iteration so that it doesn't block?\r\n* do we need to change the behaviour of Python locals? C locals that are assigned to in the loop largely become thread-local while Python locals are always shared? Does this still make sense? (Note that you can always get \"thread-local-ish\" by making the loop body a function call)",
