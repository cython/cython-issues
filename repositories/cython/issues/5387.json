For earlier versions, I think we'd have to prepend an empty string to `sys.path` ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe also don't set [`use_environment`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig.use_environment), which means that environment variables are ignored and users cannot use them to override the behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear whether Cython should always set these options, or whether users should have a way to influence them. Specifically, always allowing imports from the current directory seems risky (as noted above). It's also unclear what the use case for this is. @gamedev33, could you explain why you need the current directory in `sys.path`? Is that really needed for your embedded application to work?",

            "body": "> According to the documentation (`safe_path` was added in Py3.11), the reason why this doesn't work is different for Py3.11 and for earlier versions. In Py3.11, we could set `safe_path` to 0. For earlier versions, I think we'd have to prepend an empty string to `sys.path` ourselves.\r\n> \r\n> We also don't set [`use_environment`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig.use_environment), which means that environment variables are ignored and users cannot use them to override the behaviour.\r\n> \r\n> It's unclear whether Cython should always set these options, or whether users should have a way to influence them. Specifically, always allowing imports from the current directory seems risky (as noted above). It's also unclear what the use case for this is. @gamedev33, could you explain why you need the current directory in `sys.path`? Is that really needed for your embedded application to work?\r\n\r\nI have a config.py module necessary for the application to work, yes.\r\nIt should be reloadable, so it must be a PY file rather than a PYX one.\r\nAnd the application won't import config.py in version 3.0.0 (beta or otherwise, only alpha up to version 11 works).\r\n\r\nAppending '.' to sys.path worked as a workaround.",
