Please describe.\n\nThread local variables are nice to have in multi-threaded code.\n\nRight now one can get thread local variables using various ways:\n\nThe python import threading\n```python\nimport threading\n\nlocal = threading.local()\n\n[...]\nIf not hasattr(local, \"my_local_var\"):\n    # initialize the local for the current thread\n    local.my_local_var = somevalue\n# use local.my_local_var\n```\n\nAnother way is to use C++'s thread_local using inline C++. Yet another way would be to retrieve the thread ID and access an array.\n\nThe suggestion is to have a functionnality like thread_local directly in Cython code.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nBeing able to have thread_local variables, for instance non-object cdef class variable\n\n```cython\ncdef class myObj:\n    cdef threadlocal uint64_t some_cached_data\n    cdef uint64_t some_data_for_all_threads\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

They're all static but per-thread. I could see why per-instance per-thread would be useful but that does suggest it's not something we could implement \"directly\" in Cython.\n\nI'll have a think about how we can provide this.
