This has been deprecated or removed in Numpy (I'm not quite sure which). Either way we should update it to match the current recommendations.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Cython version\n\nBoth stable and latest documentation\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
