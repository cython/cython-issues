Note that I don't think Cython's compiler should use Tree-sitter for parsing.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Since Cython-only syntax rules would be programmatically appended to Python's, Cython's Tree-sitter grammar would have a clean architecture, containing syntax changes to Python's Tree-sitter grammar whenever they occur. (This makes sense as Cython's grammar is a superset of Python's)\r\n- The Tree-sitter grammar itself would in a way document Cython's syntax very clearly.\r\n- Improved syntax highlighting and editor support!\r\n\r\n## Cons\r\n\r\n- Having to maintain another grammar.",
