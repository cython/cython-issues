    "body": "When trying to Cythonise a file attempting to declare a variable length array, we get the following error:\r\n```\r\nError compiling Cython file:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n...\r\n    cdef double[n] x\r\n                ^\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nfile.pyx:10:17: Not allowed in a constant expression\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor C users coming to Cython, this may be a bit surprising and certainly not descriptive enough, and it doesn't seem to be mentioned in the documentation (I'm sure somewhere in there is something about Cython generating C89-compliant code, but even that I didn't find, and C programmers would have to know that VLAs were introduced in C99).\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to produce a specific error message when a variable-length array is attempted to be declared. This message could be similar to \"Cython does not support variable-length arrays\".",
