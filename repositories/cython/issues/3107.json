    "body": "In PR #2460 and #3095 we added support for a @property decorator on `CFuncDefNode`s. The support is a bit of a hack (see this [discussion](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2640#issuecomment-455453565)): the CFuncDefNode gained a is_cgetter property and that property is checked when determining the `type` in `compute_c_result_type`, `calculate_result_node` and more. It would be better to somehow\r\n- make the support more systematic rather than having type checks scattered through the code\r\n- also support @property.setter decorators and maybe others\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to go about it. What does  the suggestion to \" make them an inline node\" mean? Is this a new node type?",
