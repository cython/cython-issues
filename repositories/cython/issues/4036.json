            "body": "> @da-woods why is this only relevant for fused functions and not for regular (bound) methods?\r\n\r\nI believe that bound `CyFunction` get wrapped up with `PyMethod_New` (https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0ec9be57f5770869cb2fbe36e00bbde405b3b855/Cython/Utility/CythonFunction.c#L921) and so the method object provides the `__self__` attribute. Therefore `CyFunction` doesn't have to.\r\n\r\nFor fused functions, a bound fused function remains a fused function (so `[]` indexing still works) - https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0ec9be57f5770869cb2fbe36e00bbde405b3b855/Cython/Utility/CythonFunction.c#L1439. Therefore, they do need a `__self__` attribute.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe current status is that Cython returns the closure as `__self__` which I don't think is ever right.",
