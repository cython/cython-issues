Please describe.\n\nI think `fused_type` is a great feature.\n\nHowever, its performance is not quite sufficient for usage for lower level functions.\n\nOn my machine it adds extra 350ns for a call.\nWhich makes sense as it is approximately the same overhead that I see in `functools.singledispatch`.\nThus, I imagine it does a proper cascading/inheritance thing prioritising more strict types over more general.\n\nOne possible optimization could be to check for exact types first.\nIn `C` this would be pretty much for free.\n\nThis would be very helpful at least for the case of 1 fused type.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I'm not sure what realistic difference we'd expect that to make off the top of my head.\n\nBad naming on my side, I guess, but the `ordered` benchmarks simulates a case where the same dispatch type code is perpetually executed (thus benefiting from caching effects, branch prediction, etc.) and the `unordered` case runs the dispatch essentially in random order, changing branches on each execution. Both seem valid but different use cases, and there seems to be a visible performance difference, so I wanted to cover both in the benchmarks.\n\n> > Python 3.14.0 is uncompiled pure Python run?\n> \n> Yes. Not sure how meaningful that is here. It's just measuring a function call so doesn't do any kind of dispatch based on the type\n\n… which makes it a lower bound for the call, allowing us to estimate how much time we lose in the dispatch.",
