Please describe.\n\nI think `fused_type` is a great feature.\n\nHowever, its performance is not quite sufficient for usage for lower level functions.\n\nOn my machine it adds extra 350ns for a call.\nWhich makes sense as it is approximately the same overhead that I see in `functools.singledispatch`.\nThus, I imagine it does a proper cascading/inheritance thing prioritising more strict types over more general.\n\nOne possible optimization could be to check for exact types first.\nIn `C` this would be pretty much for free.\n\nThis would be very helpful at least for the case of 1 fused type.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
