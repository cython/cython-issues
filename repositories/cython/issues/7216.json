It's always a tradeoff between the time that is saved on user side running Cython and the time that it takes on our side to build the wheels. AFAICT, Windows/ARM is not yet an important target.\n\nDo you think it's worth adding these wheels as binaries? Do you have a need for them? Do they make a difference for you?",

I was testing some timing earlier this week (on Linux x64, rather than Windows ARM, but let's assume it's similar). Running Cython on ExprNodes.py gives:\n\n* 11.8 s uncompiled\n* 6.8 s with normal compilation\n* 8.2 s `Py_LIMITED_API=0x03090000`\n* 7.6 s `Py_LIMITED_API=0x030C0000`\n* and other Limited API versions are roughly in between, except for 3.8 which is faster for some reason but which I don't quite trust.\n\nI definitely wouldn't argue for using the Limited API for the \"important\" platforms, but it would let us cover almost all of Windows+ARM with only one extra wheel.\n\nIt'd also need a number of changes to build the right wheel so probably not something for right now.",
