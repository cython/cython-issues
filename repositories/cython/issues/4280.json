So, yes, there is a bit of overhead for this specific value. Whether that's at all visible or not will depend on the specific code. Unless `-1` turns out to be a fairly frequent return value, my guess is that you wouldn't notice it in practice, but only specific user code benchmarks can tell the truth here.\r\n\r\nEither way, I'm sure there are users who would like to add the annotation whether or not this makes a visible difference, so there is a use case for this. Thanks for insisting.\r\n\r\nSince such a signature can appear in `.pxd` files, Cython cannot (in general) analyse automatically whether an exception may get raised or not, and thus requires assistance by the user provided signature. I don't think we currently allow decorators on function signatures in `.pxd` files, so yeah, that's that.\r\n\r\nEither we turn the switch and add syntax, or we don't turn the switch for Cython 3.0.
