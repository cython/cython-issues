So, yes, there is a bit of overhead for this specific value. Whether that's at all visible or not will depend on the specific code. Unless `-1` turns out to be a fairly frequent return value, my guess is that you wouldn't notice it in practice, but only specific user code benchmarks can tell the truth here.\r\n\r\nEither way, I'm sure there are users who would like to add the annotation whether or not this makes a visible difference, so there is a use case for this. Thanks for insisting.\r\n\r\nSince such a signature can appear in `.pxd` files, Cython cannot (in general) analyse automatically whether an exception may get raised or not, and thus requires assistance by the user provided signature. I don't think we currently allow decorators on function signatures in `.pxd` files, so yeah, that's that.\r\n\r\nEither we turn the switch and add syntax, or we don't turn the switch for Cython 3.0.

Currently in Cython we have following limitation (example taken from https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4516#discussion_r806116949):\r\n1. We are not checking `None` value in cdef classes in pure python mode (In regular python functions `None` value is checked).\r\n```python\r\n@cython.cfunc\r\ndef foo(bar: Bar) -> cython.int:\r\n     # here we are not checking if bar is None and hence passing None value here is allowed.\r\n```\r\n2. `not None` keyword is not allowed in cdef functions.\r\n```cython\r\ncdef int foo(Bar bar not None):\r\n    # not None construct is not supported in cdef functions\r\n```\r\nI suppose that both examples are caused because cdef function cannot propagate `TypeError` which is raised during the check of the value. My point is that when this issue is closed, we should be able to support both cases mentioned above since exception will be propagated by default by -1 value.\r\n\r\nBoth of cases won't be supported after fixing this PR in case of `noexcept` modifier because this modifier is not enabling exception propagation from cdef function.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense what I wrote?

As soon as we make a distinction between extern and non-extern functions, we end up with the problem that function pointers need to be able to refer to both. And they seem equally likely to refer to either kind of function, maybe even with a slightly higher chance of pointing to Cython implemented (i.e. non-extern) functions, even though they are a totally C-ish thing.\r\n\r\nSo you'd end up with code like this:\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from \"someheader.h\":\r\n    int cfunc(int x)\r\n\r\ncdef int cdeffunc(int x) noexcept:\r\n    return x + 1\r\n\r\ncdef int (*func)(int x) noexcept\r\n\r\nfunc = cfunc\r\nfunc = cdeffunc\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from \"someheader.h\":\r\n    int cfunc(int x) except? -1\r\n\r\ncdef int cdeffunc(int x):\r\n    return x + 1\r\n\r\ncdef int (*func)(int x)\r\n\r\nfunc = cfunc\r\nfunc = cdeffunc\r\n```\r\nOTOH, if we make both behave the same, then we break pretty much all .pxd files out there, but end up with something more consistent:\r\n```cython\r\ncdef extern from \"someheader.h\" noexcept:\r\n    int cfunc(int x)\r\n\r\ncdef int cdeffunc(int x) noexcept:\r\n    return x + 1\r\n\r\ncdef int (*func)(int x) noexcept\r\n\r\nfunc = cfunc\r\nfunc = cdeffunc\r\n```\r\nIt feels like the decision is between \"easy to use (in most cases)\" and \"easy to explain\".\r\n\r\n(And yes, if we make all variants behave the same, then we must backport the `noexcept` modifier to 0.29.x so that users can write declarations now that still work in 3.0.)",

The large bulk of `extern` functions will be plain C functions that do not raise exceptions [*]. Those that raise exceptions are probably declared CPython API functions, almost all of which adhere to the `except -1` pattern if they return an `int`. Those few remaining `extern` functions out there that raise Python exceptions, that return an `int` and do *not* report the exception case with `-1` should ALWAYS be marked with `except XYZ` explicitly by the users who declare them.\r\n\r\n[*] that's also the main reason why `extern` functions may seem special enough to break the rules to make them easier to use. For them, it feels the other way round. If we assign them exception propagation features by default, many users may end up with inefficient code without knowing. In the same way that it's easy to forget to declare exception propagation on `cdef` functions, it's easy to forget to declare *no* exception propagation on blocks of `extern` functions.",
