Several syntax tree transformations assume that they can stop at an `ExprNode`, which they cannot any more in the future.\r\n- The control flow analysis needs updating to detect assigned names in expressions and correctly track their usage.\r\n- An assignment expression would probably always move the assigned expression into a temp variable and continue from there. There may be expressions from that rule (for simple C types) since C also supports assignments in expressions, but that sounds more like an optimisation than a requirement.",
