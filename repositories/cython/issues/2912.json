    "body": "Hello, I am having trouble with some inconsistent behaviour round the value of `__class__` in Cythonized code. This is on Python **3.6.7** with Cython **0.29.1**. \r\n\r\nBriefly, in uncythonized code `__class__` inside a method on a `class` refers to the `class` object, whereas once cythonized, it seems to refer to `<class 'module'>`. This behaviour is a bit unintuitive, and has caused a few issues in a codebase I'm working on, but it's possible I have misunderstood the language semantics! \r\n\r\nI have tried to search for reasons / documentation why this is the case, but I couldn't turn up anything. I apologise if there is something really obvious I'm missing here; let me know if so and I'll close the issue at once. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`minimal.py`:\r\n```\r\nclass Something:\r\n    def method(self):\r\n        print(__class__)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(in an interpreter, uncythonized):\r\n```\r\nfrom minimal import Something\r\nSomething().method()\r\n# prints <class 'minimal.Something'>\r\n```\r\n(after running `cythonize minimal.py -3`):\r\n```\r\nfrom minimal import Something\r\nSomething().method()\r\n# prints <class 'module'>   \r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe there is an obvious workaround -- in instance methods, `self.__class__` should still have the correct value. But I was curious if this is intended behaviour, and if so, is there something in the docs about it? ",
