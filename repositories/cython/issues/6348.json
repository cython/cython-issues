Please describe.\n\nNot sure if it's a feature or a bug but I expected this to work.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef cppclass SomeType:\r\n    SomeType(uint8_t)\r\n\r\ncdef cppclass SomeClass:\r\n    void f(SomeType)\r\n\r\ncdef void ctor_test():\r\n    cdef SomeClass c\r\n    # error: Cannot assign type 'long' to 'SomeType'\r\n    c.f(0)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nSeems that Cython doesn't have `explicit` constructors support so it can consider all of them being implicit and use rules similar to C++.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nOne alternative is to mention the type explicitly like`c.f(SomeType(0))`, this is not convenient in my particular case. Another is to add all `SomeType` constructor signatures to `SomeClass` which just doesn't make much sense to me.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
