That does not mean that an assignment leads to new entries in that dict. In fact, really only calling `locals()` changes the content, as you can see here:\r\n```python\r\n>>> def test3():\r\n...     a = locals()\r\n...     b = locals()\r\n...     c = dict(b)\r\n...     locals()\r\n...     return a, b, c\r\n... \r\n>>> test3()\r\n({'a': {...}, 'b': {...}, 'c': {'a': {...}}}, {'a': {...}, 'b': {...}, 'c': {'a': {...}}}, {'a': {'a': {...}, 'b': {...}, 'c': {...}}})\r\n```\r\n\r\nCython currently behaves slightly differently in that it creates a new dict on each access. That's ok for most use cases, but obviously differs from Python's behaviour if you explicitly look for the difference, as you do in your example.\r\n\r\nI don't see a real difference in practice, though. If you want an up-to-date version of locals(), ask for it.",
