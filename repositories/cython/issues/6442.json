(The latter will just return `1`...)\r\n\r\nHowever, the wrapper method only applies if you manually lookup `__getattr__`. If you just use the class like `C().a` then the Python runtime goes straight for the slot definition. So the speed is *exactly* the same.\r\n\r\nIt's possible I'm missing something since this long-predates me. But it seems fairly pointless at least on modern Python. So I'm dubious about the effort required to fix it.",
