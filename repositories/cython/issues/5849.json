Please describe.\n\nCurrently Cython has 2 types of documentation:\r\n* tutorials\r\n* userguides\r\n* faq\r\n\r\nThere are several features not documented by Cython:\r\n* supported data types (#5848)\r\n* tempita templating system\r\n* grammar definition\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nI think that current documentation has no place for mentioned information.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI propose to introduce new reference documentation for Cython.\r\n\r\nIt can contain following information:\r\n* data types supported by Cython (rework existing PR #https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4980)\r\n* tempita templeting system (it is already used by several project and currently is not documented)\r\n* grammar definition\r\n* Compiler options and Compiler directives from https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html\r\n* Cython API (`Cython.Build.cythonize`, ...) reference documentation\r\n* pure python mapping to Cython syntax (mainly coming from pure python tutorial)\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nTo do nothing and use userguide for documenting reference information. My personal opinion is that this is suboptimal because it complicates reading for users not fully familiar with Cython.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee https://diataxis.fr/ for more rationale.",

We have the tutorials for introducing users to the concepts and the user guide for the completer scope and deeper details. What this ticket describes seems to fit mostly into the user guide.

The Python syntax should be explained in combination with the .pyx file syntax, as we already do for many of the pages. ",
