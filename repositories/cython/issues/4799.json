    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nThere is no way to inherit default values correctly in subclasses of a dataclass when using `.pxd`. There are two cases with not clear behaviour:\r\n* Case1. If you place `@cython.dataclasses.dataclass` on cdef classes in `.pxd` then fields from parent are added to child but default values are lost and you are forced to fill this value.\r\n* Case2. You place `@cython.dataclasses.dataclass` only in `.pyx` then field is missing from `__init__` and is present in object as `None`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n`common.document.pxd`:\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class Document:\r\n    cdef public str _id\r\n```\r\n\r\n`common.document.pyx`:\r\n```cython\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\n@cython.dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True)\r\n@cython.cclass\r\ncdef class Document:\r\n    _id: str = cython.dataclasses.field(default_factory=lambda: str(bson.ObjectId()))\r\n```\r\n\r\n`common.models.account.pxd`:\r\n```cython\r\nfrom common.document cimport Document\r\n\r\ncdef class Account(Document):\r\n    cdef public int id\r\n    cdef public str username\r\n    cdef public str password\r\n\r\n    cdef public char status\r\n```\r\n\r\n`common.models.account.pyx`:\r\n```cython\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\nfrom common.document import Document\r\n\r\n@cython.dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True)\r\n@cython.cclass\r\ncdef class Account(Document):\r\n    id: cython.int\r\n    username: str\r\n    password: str\r\n    \r\n    status: cython.char = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pyximport\r\npyximport.install(language_level=3, build_in_temp=True)\r\n\r\nfrom common.model.account import Account\r\n \r\nacc = Account(id=1, username=\"test\", password=\"password\")\r\nprint(acc._id) # None\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can check Case1 by adding to `@cython.dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True)` to `Account` in `account.pxd`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFields with all their properties should be present in child as in parent.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [macOS 12.3]\r\n - Python version [3.10.0]\r\n - Cython version [3.0.0a10]\r\n",

I think it'd need the full field definition in the pxd file in order to generate the constructor correctly (since it'd have to know about `default_factory` at compile-time).
