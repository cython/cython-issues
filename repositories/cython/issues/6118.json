Ideally this'd apply to both c code and comments embedded into the c source.\r\n* Do we ever embed a date/time into the output? (I don't think so but could be wrong).\r\n* Anywhere where `set`s are iterated over and the order is important - e.g. https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5986\r\n* `dict` in older versions of Python (I'm inclined to treat this as a lost cause)\r\n* I think there may be places where the globally defined `BuiltinScope`, `CythonScope` or their entries are modified as Cython works. This means that if multiple modules are compiled in parallel then the exact output may depends on the order of parallel execution.\r\n* Other parallelization issues? (e.g. there used to be an issue with redirecting error output that was fixed in https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/f372c5ab67c73a4c28e68e2aa8bee16a2ec0e4e1, but it likely isn't the only such issue)\r\n* ????\r\n\r\nThere's then the question of how best to test it.",
