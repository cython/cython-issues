In that I relied on the `NPY_NDARRAYOBJECT_H` header include guard to identify \"real\" Numpy. In https://github.com/numpy/numpy/commit/6dff0c2f22b58b1d5d397fd8c4ab768a30d10499 they renamed their header include guard, thus breaking the fix.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/14732 and related issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4394\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'll submit a fix (and a more robust set of tests...) fairly shortly\r\n",
