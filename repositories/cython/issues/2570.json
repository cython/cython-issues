With [MSVC 2015 and UCRT]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/upgrade-your-code-to-the-universal-crt?view=msvc-170 ), which lined up with the Python 3.5 release, this became considerably more relaxed. So Python versions 3.5+ have been able to use any MSVC 2015+ (IOW VC++ 14.x) version. As older Python versions were dropped from support fewer old MSVC versions have needed support. The last of these was Python 2.7, which used MSVC 2008.\n\nBeginning in MSVC 2013 (IOW VC++ 12) support for various [C99 features were added including `stdint.h`]( https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/whats-new-for-visual-c-developers-in-vs2013-preview/#c99-libraries ). However Python never supported this version and instead jumped to MSVC 2015, which included this functionality.\n\nSo libraries that require Python 3.5 or newer, can just use MSVC without any changes needed here. Workarounds that vendored `stdint.h` can be dropped in these cases as well.",
