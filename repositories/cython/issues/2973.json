            "body": "I'll explain why I'm using this.\r\n\r\nFor pygame, we have most of the source code in src_c/, including .pyx files. Relative `cimport`s from subpackages (eg src_c/subpackage) do not work, because Cython tries to import the module `src_c.package.module` at runtime, or it fails with an error message about relative imports beyond root.\r\n\r\nSo I moved all the .pyx files into src_c/cython/pygame. Now it works, but `cythonize()` didn't let me output .c files to src_c/ rather than src_c/pygame, so I duplicated some of the code from `cythonize()` in our setup script. But I'd also like to check dependencies.\r\n\r\nSo I have two other suggestions:\r\n1. `cythonize()` might allow allow you to specify per-extension paths to .c files instead of using a hardcoded name.\r\n2. Relative cimports might do relative imports with the C API at runtime rather than absolute imports, if possible.",
