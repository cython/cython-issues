From Cython's point of view the advantage of `cython.compiled` is that it's know at compile-time.\r\n\r\nYou can do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n    from cython import compiled\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n   # either\r\n   compiled = False\r\n   # or\r\n   globals()['compiled'] = False\r\n```\r\nto avoid needing the import.\r\n\r\nI can't find much documentation on `sys.frozen` but it possibly implies bundled bytecode, so it might be actively misleading to set it for Cython. I definitely don't think it's a bug that it isn't set.\r\n",

Yes fully automatic.\r\nBut very huge exe size (7MB) even for 100 lines of single file code.\r\nAnd I don't think the output file is native machine code exe (Not 100% sure yet).\r\nI got upset still that is using unsafe/unsecure CPython byte code (Not 100% sure yet).\r\n\r\nSame code I tried in Cython and the size is just 200K\r\nAnd the output exe is 100% native machine code.\r\nSecured and safe from reverse engineering (Binary to Source code not possible)\r\n\r\nSo I plan to make my own python script for Cython compiler.\r\nI don't know how to bundle my own import modules *.py file.\r\nI learned making *.so files from cython. But all are separate .so files.\r\nI need all in one executable binary.\r\n\r\n**My python project:**\r\n\r\nMainExecutable.py\r\n      | import GeneralFunctions (.py)\r\n      | import Encrypt (.py)\r\n      | import Decrypt (.py)\r\n      | import Settings (.py)\r\n      \r\nI need only single binary **MainExecutable**\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease help me...\r\n\r\n",

It's generally quite a difficult problem and not one that we're interesting in solving.\r\n\r\nWe also aren't really interested in making a tool to obfuscate people's source code. We're aware that people use it for that (and this is fine... it's open source so use it for what you like). But it isn't a use case that we care about.\r\n\r\nGithub issues are for feature suggestions and bugs. Please direct ask further support questions on the Cython-user's mailing list https://groups.google.com/g/cython-users - it's possible that some people there may have solutions for some of your problems.",
