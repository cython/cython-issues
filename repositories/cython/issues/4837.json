The reason is that \"type or a subclass\" is pretty much useless when it comes to making optimizations (given that it's possible to override basically anything).\r\n\r\nThis obviously deviates a bit from what's specified in the typing module. However what you're seeing is the expected behaviour at the moment.\r\n\r\nYou could turn off the `annotation_typing` option to get it to work. Unfortunately that's currently only available at the module level. Or just omit those specific types.",
