I need to copy them into my project somewhere, and if the includes are then updated, I need to copy them again, for all projects that depend on those files.\r\nIt would be helpful if Cython had a function, say in Cython.Build, which copied a specified PXD file into a default location where the Cython compiler can always find it.\r\nThis function could take two arguments, the first one being a path to the PXD file, and its second being the full module name of the PXD, which will be used when cimporting this file and is needed here so that this function can copy the file to the appropriate directory.",
