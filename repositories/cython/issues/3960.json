I think typically the way to do it is to pass raw object pointers and let the user make their own mess of it but there isn't a good general solution for it.\r\n\r\nI think maintenance of the numpy pxd files has now largely been handed over to Numpy -  the Cython one's are being kept around for the time being (until enough people have upgraded to the version of Numpy that bundles them) but aren't really being improved.",
