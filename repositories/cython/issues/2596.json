Other proposals welcome.)\r\n\r\nWe obviously then need a bunch of tests for this, especially tests for the line number reporting. Tests should go into `tests/build/`.\r\n\r\nPR welcome.",

Designing a robust \"macro-like\" language seems like a fairly hard problem, especially since Cython is pretty constrained to be close to Python syntax.\r\n\r\nI've generally recommended Tempita for this kind of problem (just because it's there, and because people like Numpy and Scipy already use it), so building it into the build process a little more thoroughly seems like a good idea.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer not killing off `DEF` and `IF` _too_ quickly. I definitely think we should deprecate them, issue a warning, and refuse to add new features to them. But I don't think they're causing much harm just by existing, so I'd rather leave a good long while for people to adapt and make sure that our proposed replacement is actually fit for purpose. To me Cython 3.1 seems too soon (given that the gap between 3.0 and 3.1 is currently planned to be fairly short).",

            "body": "Yeah some kind of templating in Cython could be pretty powerful, but probably needs to be done thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nTempita does seem like an easy way forward. Think there are some libraries already using it (like [scikit-learn]( https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/search?q=tempita )). There are other templating libraries like this in the wild (like [Jinja]( https://jinja.palletsprojects.com )) that might also make sense. It might be worth considering how to templating while maintaining Python looking code (valuable for linting, reading by new devs, pure Python mode, etc.).\r\n\r\nFused types can already be pretty useful on their own. One can even use these to do [SFINAE]( https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae ) like things in Cython. For example here's an `enable_if` analogue in Cython ( https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2660#issuecomment-687493653 ).\r\n\r\nHave wondered if C++ style templating could be used in Cython directly.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is worth enumerating what use cases templating would support?",
