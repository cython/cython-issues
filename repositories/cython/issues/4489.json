    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen compiling on Windows, Cython seems to create a read-only file and then attempt to delete it, always resulting in an access denied error even when run from an administrator shell.\r\n\r\nThis is a new issue that seems to have started relatively recently without any changes in my build process. It also only appears on Windows, everything worked fine when I was testing on [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).\r\n\r\nHere's the relevant part of the build log:\r\n```\r\n    Generating code\r\n    Finished generating code\r\n    copying build\\lib.win-amd64-3.9\\cPyparsing.cp39-win_amd64.pyd ->\r\n    error: could not delete 'cPyparsing.cp39-win_amd64.pyd': Access is denied\r\n```\r\n(and [here](https://gist.github.com/evhub/dd854a9833204ea2fc3c79325969dc82) is a gist with the full log)\r\n\r\nThe file it is attempting to delete here is one that it previously created in my `build` directory, and this error persists even when run as administrator. It's entirely possible I'm just doing something dumb, but if so I'm not sure what it could be.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe Cython project I've been experiencing this error with is [`cPyparsing`](https://github.com/evhub/cpyparsing). It should be reproducible if you clone the repository and `pip install -e .` on Windows.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAt least when run as administrator, I shouldn't be seeing access denied errors.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Python version: 3.9.7\r\n - Cython version: 0.29.24",
