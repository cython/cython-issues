    "body": "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nCurrently, SageMath has a `cdef class LazyImport` that constructs a \"lazy import\" object that in (almost every) way behave like the original object.\n\nExample code\n\n```\n        sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport\n        sage: my_integer = LazyImport('sage.rings.integer', 'Integer')\n        sage: my_integer(4)\n        4\n```\n\nThis is done by defining `__getattr__` and `__call__` and `__repr__` etc. on objects of the `LazyImport` class.\n\nThere is one way where the `LazyImport` object cannot mimic the original object however: `type()`.\n\nIn practice, this is hardly a problem, but it is a problem in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/41213\n\n```\nfrom sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport\nTensorAlgebra = LazyImport('sage.algebras.tensor_algebra', 'TensorAlgebra')\n\nTensorAlgebra(CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [\"a\", \"b\"]))  # works well, __call__ is overridden\n```\n\nbut:\n\n```\nclass Example(TensorAlgebra):\n    pass\n\nExample(CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [\"a\", \"b\"]))  # error!\n```\n\nthe reason is that the class declaration is \"syntactic sugar\" for essentially the following\n\n```\nExample = type(TensorAlgebra).__new__(type(TensorAlgebra), 'Example', (TensorAlgebra,), {\"__module__\": \"__main__\", \"__qualname__\": \"Example\"})\n```\n\nwhich resolves to (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64896883/what-does-it-mean-for-a-class-to-inherit-from-an-object-which-is-not-a-type)\n\n```\nExample = LazyImport.__new__(LazyImport, 'Example', (TensorAlgebra,), {\"__module__\": \"__main__\", \"__qualname__\": \"Example\"})\n```\n\nwhich makes `Example` an instance of `LazyImport` instead of a type.\n\nI can think of a few quick fixes, but the easiest appears to be to redefine `LazyImport.__new__` to return `type.__new__(type, 'Example', (TensorAlgebra,), {...})` instead of a `LazyImport` instance.\n\nHowever, when I try to override `__new__` (so that the result is something not an instance of `LazyImport`), I get\n\n```\n/home/user202729/sage/src/sage/misc/lazy_import.pyx:202:4: __new__ method of extension type will change semantics in a future version of Pyrex and Cython. Use __cinit__ instead.\n```\n\nis there a way to override `__new__` anyway? Or any other way?\n\n------\n\nSome other solutions I can think of include\n\n- make `class LazyImport` no longer an extension class so that `__new__` is override-able. (not sure about the performance impact)\n- redefine `tp_new` (?) (like what `cdef class Integer` is using)\n\n\nedit: actually `tp_new` is re-assignable, as shown in `Integer` class in sage, as well as https://github.com/sagemath/sage/pull/41223 . I wonder why redefining `__new__` directly is not possible though.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

            "body": "The answer is currently \"no\" but I think it's mostly because nobody has done it rather than because we're opposed to it.\n\nThe slightly difficult bit is the interaction with `__cinit__` - we put `__cinit__` in the `tp_new` slot but it's obviously a lot less flexible than `__new__` (you're required to return the correct type for example). That requires a bit of thought about how to do it right. The simplest answer might be \"if you have `__new__` you can't have `__cinit__` (including derived classes)\".\n\n--------------------------\n\nThe other (semi-related) thing that I think we should do better is support for `cdef staticmethod` factory functions. They're always a bit awkward because arguments to `__cinit__` must be Python types. It'd be nice if there was a clean way to ban direct instantiation from Python but let you create an instance from Cython. There's workarounds but they aren't hugely nice.",
