The test was on Windows, and I ended up with a C syntax error from MSVC. I did not dig deeper, but most likely, the compiler error was related to Cython-generated code not being able to cope with such version mismatch.\n\nWhat should Cython do?\n1. Nothing at all, then users may end up with obscure failures like the one I got.\n2. Redefine `Py_LIMITED_API` to **LOWER** version matching `PY_VERSION_HEX`, ignoring the ambiguity. This should be safe as long as users are calling manually to Python C/API routines outside the (older) Stable ABI version, otherwise the C code will fail to compile.\n3. Add a preprocessor `#error` statement to C code pointing users to the mismatch. We are already using `#error` to inform users about missing Python headers.\n\nFrom `python -m this` *In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess* therefore I believe we should side with option (3) above.\n\nThoughts?\n",
