This could be quite literally any recent commit, with the one caveat that we're relying on no more ABI changes to publish builds in advance (which CPython promises post-rc1). If that's not possible for Cython yet, then we're up a certain creek without a paddle... 😅 \r\n\r\nI saw that the 3.0.x branch recently added the 3.13 classifier (https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/5fa0660e3901bc5a6ec573d0ea320588d59effa2), so 3.0.12 would be even better than 3.1.0a1. :)",

There's necessarily a lowest version being tested, if only implicitly by what CI agents offer... On the other hand, all the osx-64 builds for all the other CPython versions built fine with CPython 3.0.11, so it's still the most likely scenario to me that this is related to 3.13.",
