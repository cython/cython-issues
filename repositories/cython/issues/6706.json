Most other arbitrary Python code execution due to finalizers can be avoided by writing code that carefully keeps references alive until done. But the GC is hard to avoid and therefore it'd be useful for users to have control over it.\n\nThere's maybe also a question of \"should we do this by default in a critical_section\" block? I suspect probably not because it has a cost.",
