So it'd let us match more closely with the implementations using the C/C++ standard library.\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise this mostly matters on non-x86 platforms (I believe).\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that it requires gcc-4.7 (2012) instead of 4.4 (2009). We do have fallback (locked) code though. I don't think this version bump is hugely restrictive but posting here to gather objections.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately MSVC is (predictably) as mess, and doesn't have an sensible upgrade from what we have.",

            "body": "The GCC minimum version bump looks completely harmless, no one is using GCC versions that old anymore. We do regular conservative bumps in NumPy, and are at >=9.3.0 now - I can't remember any recent complaint, it's been years since the last one when we bumped from 6.x to 8.x.\n\nHowever, I think the real thing to worry about is whether this introduces a new requirements to link against `libatomic` on 32-bit and maybe also some other niche platforms. `__sync` functions usually don't require that, but `__atomic` ones do more often. If that's the case for regular usage of memoryviews, that is likely to be a blocker here.
