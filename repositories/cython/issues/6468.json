So it'd let us match more closely with the implementations using the C/C++ standard library.\r\n\r\nPerformance-wise this mostly matters on non-x86 platforms (I believe).\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that it requires gcc-4.7 (2012) instead of 4.4 (2009). We do have fallback (locked) code though. I don't think this version bump is hugely restrictive but posting here to gather objections.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately MSVC is (predictably) as mess, and doesn't have an sensible upgrade from what we have.",
