However, in the C code injected into generated modules, the default value of `CYTHON_PROFILE` for non-limited API builds is actually 1. Is that expected? If so, why the divergence from the behavior of the directive?\n\nI ran into this in the context of https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7050, which I would have expected to be impossible in a build without profiling manually enabled, but we turn out to hit because the monitoring function calls [are injected whenever `CYTHON_PROFILE` is on](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/595ba7c9ebf071ce486d411a8b2384e5291a2239/Cython/Utility/Profile.c#L100). Of course, `CYTHON_USE_SYS_MONITORING` must be on too, but I would have thought that the monitoring support would only be activated if profiling was requested.",

Although may not be very well-explained.\n\n```\n# cython: profile=False\n... # code goes here\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n... # code goes here\n```\n\nboth generate absolutely no profiling code at all.\n\n```\n# cython: profile=True\n... # code goes here\n```\n\nwill generate profiling code. The profiling code can then be turned on and off by defining the C macro `CYTHON_PROFILE`. We don't say anything about the default for this C macro in the documentation, but it's on by default where supported.  That's been the case for as long as we've supported this I think.\n\nSo in the context of https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/7050, you must at least have the `profile` directive set somewhere in order to trigger this.\n\nWe can definitely document what the macros do a bit better but I don't think we want to change it, just because it's the long-standing behaviour that a lot of people are using.",
