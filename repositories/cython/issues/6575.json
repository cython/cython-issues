They're is a hacky workaround and a few third-party tools that automate the hacky workaround described at https://stackoverflow.com/q/30157363.\r\n\r\nI don't really recommend spending too much time trying to make this work though - it isn't how Cython is designed to operate and you will run into problems.\r\n\r\n> we want to protect the code\r\n\r\nThis is a use case that I personally am not interested in supporting (I think most of the other Cython devs feel similarly, but I can't say that with absolute confidence).\r\n\r\nCython is open source so you're welcome to use it however you like. But we generally haven't implemented features that are only of interest for \"protecting\" code.",
