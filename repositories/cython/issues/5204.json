Please describe.\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nDownstream projects using Cython as a development dependencies might need to check Cython version for nightly build. Currently, there is no way to programmatically assess if the an installed version of Cython comes from an (alpha) release or from the source because the version number is not incorporating this information:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/ac56a661b6d670b69f24fb92408dd852a583b08d/Cython/Shadow.py#L4\r\n\r\n[PEP 440 introduced public version identifiers](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers) and in particular Development release segment which allow knowing programmatically that packages have been installed from a development version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nUse public version identifiers with a Development release segment.\r\n\r\nThat is change:\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/ac56a661b6d670b69f24fb92408dd852a583b08d/Cython/Shadow.py#L4\r\n\r\nfor:\r\n```python\r\n __version__ = \"3.0.0a12.dev0\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/pull/5205/ has been opened accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nFor scikit-learn, this limitation was recently met in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25300#discussion_r1064966103.",
