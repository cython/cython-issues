Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI'm testing reportlab with latest python alpha 5; I use lxml. This built fine in 3.11.0a3, but fails in 3.11.0a5.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n. bin/activate\r\npip install cython #this works fine\r\npip install lxml fails\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected it to build as in the previous alpha 3; there was an alpha 4, but it was withdrawn so far as I can tell. If I build a wheel with 3.11.0a3 it will install in 3.11.0a5, but I think that is unsafe.\r\n\r\n**Environment :**\r\n - OS:arch linux amd64\r\n - Python version 3.11.0a5\r\n - Cython version 0.29.27\r\n\r\n\r\n[lxml-311a5-install-failure.log](https://github.com/cython/cython/files/8054589/lxml-311a5-install-failure.log)\r\n[lxml-311a3-install-success.log](https://github.com/cython/cython/files/8054591/lxml-311a3-install-success.log)\r\n\r\n",
