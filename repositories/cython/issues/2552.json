I don't actually know if that happens before or after the assignment to the name (which might fail, but could be shadowed by a try-except). Probably something to test in CPython. Thus: tests.",

You can check them out [here](https://github.com/ra-kete/cython/blob/pyclass-annotations-pep526/tests/run/pyclass_annotations_pep526.py).\r\n\r\nI have two main questions now:\r\n1. Do we need full compliance with CPython or would you also consider merging something incomplete if it enables the (correct) use of dataclasses and NamedTuples? I think it should be pretty straightforward to add the annotations to the `__annotations__` dict (passing test case `Annotations` above), which should be enough for the aforementioned use cases. I'm not sure how hard it would be to satisfy some of the other test cases though.\r\n2. @scoder's explanation above was quite helpful (thanks!), but it seems that `NameNode.generate_assignment_code` is only invoked for actual assignments. So if we have a type annotated class variable that doesn't get a value assigned (i.e. just `foo: int`), we cannot add that to `__annotations__` this way. Is there some function that's invoked for class variable declarations regardless of assignment?\r\n",

The result can be prepended (?) to the `self.body.stats` list (`self.body` is a `StatListNode`), as an assignment expressed in a `SingleAssignmentNode` (see the usages in `Parsing.py`), which should assign the `DictNode` result to an `IdentifierStringNode` for the `__annotations__` key (in Python: `__annotations__ = {…}`). The rest should then happen more or less automatically from the syntax tree nodes.\r\n\r\nI also think that it's probably a good idea to _move_ the annotations over from their owning nodes into the `DictNode` values, i.e. set them to `None`, to prevent duplicate node references in the tree. I don't think they are used elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis also seems worth a new method. :)",
