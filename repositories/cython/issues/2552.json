Look at the other `pyclass` tests to see how it's done, we basically use doctests (which are executed in Python and not compiled, as opposed to the rest of the file).\r\n\r\nI first thought that this could be implemented after executing the class body, but it turns out that [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/#runtime-effects-of-type-annotations) wants the `__annotations__` dict to be available before that, so creating the empty dict and assigning it in `__Pyx_Py3MetaclassPrepare()` would be the right way.\r\n\r\nThen each `NameNode` inside of the class body (`entry.is_pyclass_attr`) which holds a `self.annotation` will have to generate C code (in `generate_assignment_code()`) to look up the `__annotations__` dict in the class scope and assign its name to its annotation `.py_result()` on an assignment (or creation of the name). I don't actually know if that happens before or after the assignment to the name (which might fail, but could be shadowed by a try-except). Probably something to test in CPython. Thus: tests.",
