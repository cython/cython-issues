The documentation for the \"wrapping C\" part of Cython does assume that you know C, and you'll find plenty of C-related pitfalls)\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice. I, of course, was hoping to avoid (most of) C altogether but still get access to the raw power of this library by wrapping it. No free lunch for me I guess. I will learn a bit of C and put some 'pointers' in the Cython documentation afterward to useful resources to read when wrapping libraries.",
