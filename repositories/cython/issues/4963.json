This is not a hardware issue, the Windows VMs seem to be much faster according to the end-of-run timings (e.g. Cython translation takes 150s on Windows vs. 440s on Linux). But the C compilation times are completely the opposite, e.g. 10,000s on Windows vs. 220s on Linux.\r\n\r\nProbable reasons are:\r\n1) missing ccache\r\n2) different C compiler options\r\n\r\nWe are clearly wasting computing resources here, and also make ourselves wait a long time to get CI feedback on changes.

Splitting out a separate workflow config for it shouldn't be difficult, it can still use the same bash script.",
