We already have a different traceline for line 7 further up when it does the `__pyx_t_4 = __Pyx_PyErr_ExceptionMatches(((PyObject *)(&((PyTypeObject*)PyExc_Exception)[0])));` check. Which seems like the appropriate thing to consider as \"line 7\". But I've never seriously looked into linetracing either so perhaps don't understand what it's trying to do here.",
