It turned into something that seems both a very nice behaviour to have and no longer suitable for a release candidate.\n\nBasically, it widens the meaning of the Python types `int` and `float` (and potentially `complex`) to accept compatible types, so that you can write\n```python\ndef func(arg: float | None):\n    assert arg is None or type(arg) is float  # definitely an object\n\nfunc(5)  # passes the Python float object 5.0, instead of raising a TypeError as it did before\n```\nAnd similarly, it accepts subtypes of numeric builtin number types and internally converts them to their builtin base type. Previously, subtypes of builtin types were rejected if you typed the function argument as `x: int`, for example.\n\nI'm aware that this is not what Python does. It's a tradeoff between static typing that employs exact builtin type declarations for speed improvements (but annoyingly rejects everything else) and Python typing semantics that happily accepts 'int' for 'float' typed arguments and variables (and that even generally allows any type at runtime), and that does not care whether it receives a builtin type or subtype, obeying the subtype's behaviour.\n\nFor Cython, builtin type or subtype makes the difference between \"I know how the type behaves and can optimise it\" and \"any behaviour might be overridden and I cannot make any assumptions\". Converting to the base type helps in two ways: it no longer rejects subtypes, but still allows static assumptions about the (converted) object at hand.\n\nThis is a risky change at this late point. I would normally vote for postponing it. But to me, the relaxation in type acceptance seems very tempting, and solves real world problems.\n\nI'd be happy to get some feedback and testing for the PR.",

            "body": "> This is a risky change at this late point. I would normally vote for postponing it. But to me, the relaxation in type acceptance seems very tempting, and solves real world problems.\n\nPlease please consider putting it into 3.2 🙏🏼. #5750 seems of _very_ low importance to be honest, compared to getting out a release with free-threading support that we've been very keen to see since about August last year, and the lack of which is causing a lot of issues and extra work. Plus a lot of other nice features like better Limited API support and support for shared components - getting any one of those features into the hands of users sooner is by itself already a lot more impactful than a change to #5750 one release earlier.\n\nExample of delay impact for shared components: we have SciPy 1.16.0rc1 scheduled for May 21st (final release in June), and I'd really like to be able to use the shared component feature - the [benefit](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/22775#issuecomment-2772174824) of that is large enough that we implemented support for it in SciPy within days of it being merged in Cython `master`. Holding off on a Cython release candidate now to merge a late risky change sounds like it'll cause Cython 3.1.0 to not be available in time for SciPy 1.16.\n\nOn #5750 itself: it has only one incoming link from the Ray project which then worked around it, so not really a burning issue. And there is no ideal solution to that issue anyway since Python static typing semantics are different, as you say there.",

Without this change, we're probably set for a RC.\n\nNote, though, that https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/6808 isn't just about fixing https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5750. That issue was more of a trigger to get working on it. The PR improves on several long standing annoyances in the language that let users run into differences between builtin types and extension types, prevent typed Python code from being accepted by Cython, make compiled code behave differently from the original Python code, etc. We cannot resolve these issues completely, but I consider it a visible step towards more user friendly typing.\n\nBut I can live with it missing 3.1. It will definitely benefit from a longer testing period.",
