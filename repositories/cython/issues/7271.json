RHEL-7 has now gone out of maintenance\n- RHEL-9 has Python 3.9 and will be around for another 7+ years (https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata)\n- Fedora has retired 3.8 support in April 2025 (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/RetirePython3.8)\n- Amazon Linux 2023 uses Python 3.9, EOL scheduled for June 2029 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AL2/latest/relnotes/relnotes-20251014.html)\n- Amazon Linux 2 used Python 3.7 and will reach its EOL in June 2026 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AL2/latest/relnotes/relnotes-20250201.html)\n\nSo, RHEL-9 and Amazon Linux 2023 are reasons to stick with Py3.9 for several years.\nBut that seems a good base line to support for Cython 3.3+.",
