Note that the\r\n  support is currently in an early stage and many features do not yet work.\r\n  Patches by Eddie Elizondo and David Woods.  (Github issues :issue:`3223`,\r\n  :issue:`3311`, :issue:`3501`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDespite the above, it seems that this functionality was \"hard disabled\" in 0c01ea5d8e (April 10th, 2020; interestingly, this change was made *before* CHANGES.rst was updated):\r\n\r\n```\r\n#if defined(CYTHON_LIMITED_API) && 0  /* disabled: enabling Py_LIMITED_API needs more work */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, there's no way to get this to work from the outside, because of the `&& 0`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it isn't documented (e.g., in CHANGES.rst) that this **really** doesn't work.\r\n\r\nWould it be reasonable to open-up a PR documenting (e.g., in CHANGES.rst) that `CYTHON_LIMITED_API` isn't ready for prime-time? What's in CHANGES.rst currently is more optimistic about the status of this feature than the actuality :)",
