The mental model I had for cythonize before actually looking at the code was that it operated in roughly four stages:\r\n\r\n1) Use user-passed information and file-system lookups to build a `CompilationOptions` object and collect all the relevant source files.\r\n2) Parse the cython source files into some sort of internal representation, call it a Pseudo-AST (pAST)\r\n3) Apply optimizations to the pAST.\r\n4) Convert the pAST into C code.\r\n\r\nThe goal for this Issue as I understand it is to expose the pAST at the end of Step2 (or 3).  So two questions:\r\n- Is this an accurate characterization of the goal?\r\n- Does there currently exist an object that corresponds to the pAST?  AFAICT the answer is \"no\" because steps 2-4 are intertwined.\r\n\r\n(NB: I've spent enough time trying to understand the code to have opinions about it, but not well-informed opinions.  Take all statements below with an implicit \"If I understand correctly...\")\r\n\r\nYou have to squint and tilt your head a bit to see the correspondence between the code and these four steps.\r\n\r\nStep 1 would include most of Build.Cythonize, Build.Dependencies, parts of Compiler.Main, and all of Compiler.Options, Compiler.DebugFlags, Compiler.CmdLine.  Also Tempita I guess.\r\n\r\nStep 2 would include Plex and Compiler.Scanning (possibly Errors and Future for the sake of the dependency graph).  There are other Compiler modules that might belong here conceptually (e.g. Parsing), but I have a really hard time telling because of the dependencies within Compiler.\r\n\r\nStep 3 I'm pretty sure would include Pipeline and Optimize.  Everything else I can't really tell where Step 3 stops and Step 4 starts.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n<b>Brainstorming A GamePlan</b>\r\n\r\nI claim that it is possible to refactor the code such that Step 1 is self-contained and returns a CompilationOptions object.  The remainder of Cython.Build would then have an entrypoint that just takes a CompilationOptions object as its sole input.\r\n\r\nFrom there I'm not sure what to do.  The first thing Step 2 would do is create a Context object from the passed CompilationOptions.  After that I haven't tracked down how it gets from there to Scanning and Plex.",

It may be the case that an API that lets me get back a ModuleNode will be good enough for my purposes.  @alexbw what do you think?\r\n\r\n@scoder would you be open to the refactor of Step 1 mentioned above?  I think simplification of the dependency structure would soften the learning curve for newcomers.  Both the [learning curve](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/DagSverreSeljebotn-PipelineThoughts) and the [refactor](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/smallprojects#4-unit-test-and-replace-the-command-line-parser) are mentioned in the Wiki you linked.  The general idea of making the separation between Steps 2 and 3 explicit seems to be similar to CEP 901, CEP 905",

            "body": "[CEP 901](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/enhancements-parsetreetransforms) is essentially how things work today, using a multi-step pipeline with transformations that use the visitor pattern. You can chain pipeline steps to get whatever outcome you want (although many steps depend on previous ones – and before you ask, yes, for good reason: it's a pipeline). Note that the Wiki pages are much older than the current implementation.\r\n\r\nAlso look at the `TreeFragment` module, it's a way to run a user defined pipeline against a code string. We use it in a couple of places (also in tests) to compile and integrate code fragments.\r\n\r\nI agree that most of the modules in `Cython.Build` do not exactly shine from their design. They mostly work and get their job done. `Dependencies` implements most of `cythonize()`, for example, which is weird. Still, most of that isn't really important for the problem at hand. If all you want is a parse tree, then look at `Main.py` and its [`parse()`](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/d98e7a96970e2c8af18c35aeb562ee5f9bdd38b4/Cython/Compiler/Main.py#L354-L381) function. That module is the original entry point of the `cython` frontend tool.\r\n\r\nThe newer `cythonize()` implementation is written in a way that mostly avoids touching the original code, which IMHO is the wrong trade-off. There is quite a bit of obfuscation going on when it comes to finding files, also relative to the current source file or in the Python path. Lots of jumping back and forth between methods. If you want to try a refactoring, that's a good target. But it's not in this ticket.\r\n\r\nTo get to know the parse tree it's probably best to follow the [HackerGuide](https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/HackerGuide#getting-started), enable the [`debug_trace_code_generation`](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/d98e7a96970e2c8af18c35aeb562ee5f9bdd38b4/Cython/Compiler/DebugFlags.py#L12) debug option, and then look at the C code that Cython generates.",

This is because `FusedTypeNode.childattrs` is empty\r\n\r\nI have to patch this by adding `'types'` to `child_attrs` - would this (and the other patches in the link) be OK to do here in `Cython` directly? I asked about this one in the mailing list and was told\r\n\r\n> The effect of not including it in `child_attrs` is that `types` isn't processed by `ParseTreeTransforms` but just left as is. As far as I can tell nothing interesting actually gets done with `CSimpleBaseTypeNode` or `CBaseTypeNode` by anything in `ParseTreeTransforms`. Therefore leaving it out practically makes no difference.\r\n>\r\n> It possibly is an omission, but not one that has any consequence for Cython itself.",
