As a result, code that attempts to use CYTHON_LIMITED_API will end up with a compile warning or error. A naive fix is simply to materialize the values, something like:\r\n\r\n`flags = [ str(inspect.CO_OPTIMIZED), str(inspect.CO_NEWLOCALS)]`. \r\n\r\nThis just moves the goal post though - the surrounding `__Pyx_PyCode_New` also does not exist in the limited API. It's not clear what the correct way to suppress or patch PyCode related symbols is.\r\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Cython version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
