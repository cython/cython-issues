    "body": "According to https://peps.python.org/pep-0683/#stable-abi, using `Py_INCREF/Py_DECREF` won't break anything, but if it's compiled against `Py_LIMITED_API` < 3.12 then it will change the reference count of immortal objects when run on Python versions >3.12. That's because the implementation of `Py_INCREF` and `Py_DECREF` is inlined, so it can't easily be changed while maintaining compatibility.\r\n\r\nChanging the reference count of immortal objects means we lose the performance advantages of immortal objects.\r\n\r\nThe change is only beneficial in the limited API - outside the limited API `Py_INCREF` is always the most up-to-date version.\r\nWe should make this change everywhere at once, otherwise we risk being inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWe should do it in one PR that changes the whole of Cython (and has no other changes in it).\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @da-woods in https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6061#issuecomment-1981433898_",
