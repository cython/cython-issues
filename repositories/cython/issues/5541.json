The solution is take the pymssql repo and change the build configuration fixing cython version.\r\nI need to do this on an older version of pymssql, so I did a fork and I created a new branch from the tag, this was a little diff configuration than the current one. But the next version of pymssql would probably be fixed with the @marcwimmer's PR or some other.\r\nThanks everyone that helped.",
