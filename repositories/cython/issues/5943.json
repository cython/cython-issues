Cython mean in the code snippets of both the [3.1](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html) and [3.0](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html) tutorial versions ― are they just two types of allowed syntax or is the \"Pure Python\" syntax a more limited subset of what one can do with \"cython syntax\" ―\r\n\r\nObviously that is well answered in https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html but _**may I suggest that the first pages refer to the latter for clarity and avoidance of doubt**_. \r\n\r\nOn the same aspect though more specific, the tutorial pages from above refere to (quoting) \"The cythonize version\", but it remains a little vague (to me) which version of the code on that page this description refers to, or the term cythonize is just too ambiguous to be of help in a tutorial flow, at least for the rest of us limited humans out there. \r\n\r\nThanks for all the hard work, and hope this helps infinitesimally.\r\n",
