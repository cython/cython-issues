    "body": "Currently, Cython generates a generic call to `PyObject_RichCompare()` for `>` / `<` comparisons against known (e.g. constant) integers (also see #602). The (in-)equality case is already optimised into a fast C level digit comparison. This should also be done for `>`, `>=`, `<=` and `<` iff the result is definitely a boolean, e.g. because it is fed into an `if` statement. The current equality comparison optimisation already does this.\r\n\r\nExtend the `PyIntCompare` utility code to cover boolean comparisons of Python integers with known, small (i.e. single PyLong digit) integers. Basically, if the Python integer value that is being compared against has more than one PyLong digit, then it is definitely larger than the single digit constant. If it has exactly one digit, then it can be compared as C integers. If it is zero, then the result is obvious, too.\r\n",
