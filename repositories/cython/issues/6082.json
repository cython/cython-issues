However:\r\n\r\nI've created a \"limited API preview\" branch (https://github.com/cython/cython/tree/limited-api-preview) that collates unreviewed/unmerged PRs on the limited API. This is to allow anyone interested to do some advanced testing.\r\n\r\nThe current status is that this branch should be able to build a working version of Cython under the limited API. Not much beyond that is tested.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to keep this strictly up-to-date with master. It's just a snapshot of something that worked at a point in time.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely not my intention to release wheels or anything like that.\r\n\r\nThe branch will disappear in future when the world is merged.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to test it/build on it/whatever",
