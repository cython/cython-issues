I don't think it is good practice for user to modify it. \r\n\r\nIn my repos involved Cython source code, generated `*.c` is supposed to be ignored. However, there is also some user-written `*.c` code in the project, As a result, it make source code management difficult, I have to add the line of code to explicitly delete them after pyximport.\r\n\r\nMoving them to `pyx_build_dir` would make situation a lot easier.",
