Please describe.\n\nOne confusing feature of Cython dataclasses is that you have to cimport `cython.dataclasses.dataclass` and `cython.dataclasses.field` to use them, but all other dataclass-related imports (e.g. `dataclasses.ClassVar` and any runtime dataclass functions you want to access) come from the standard library `dataclasses` module.\r\n\r\nThere were good reasons for this at the time, but I think it's just a source of confusion to people. Therefore we should probably just take a `@dataclasses.dataclass` decorator on a `cdef` class to mean \"Cython dataclass\".\r\n\r\n(We should also do the same for `total_ordering` while we're at it)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nI'm slightly uncomfortable with co-opting someone else's module for our own behaviour. This'd especially be a concern if we ever allowed arbitrary decorators on `cdef classes` (in which case people might legitimately want to use the standard library module directly). However that's probably unlikely.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis was discussed before in a comment somewhere which I now can't find...",
