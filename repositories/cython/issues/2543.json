    "body": "I managed to get inspect working, mostly, with cython files using `binding=True`. However, now I ran into another issue where `co_filename` is set to the relative path of the pyx file at the time of the compile. This means that as soon as you you change directory, we cannot find the source file using `co_filename` as it doesn't map to the right path.\r\n\r\nLooking at the generated c file, the problem is with the filename passed to `__Pyx_PyCode_New`. The value seems to be generated here: https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Compiler/ExprNodes.py#L9396. By changing `file_path = StringEncoding.bytes_literal(func.pos[0].get_filenametable_entry().encode('utf8'), 'utf8')` to `file_path = StringEncoding.bytes_literal(os.path.abspath(func.pos[0].get_filenametable_entry()).encode('utf8'), 'utf8')`, the abs path was saved in the generated c file. Although I'm not sure this is the correct fix, or whether there are other implications to saving the full path.\r\n\r\nMy `kv_cython_test.pyx` file contains\r\n```py\r\n#cython: binding=True\r\n\r\nfrom kivy.uix.widget import Widget\r\nfrom kivy.lang.compiler import KV, KVCtx\r\n\r\nclass MyWidget(Widget):\r\n\r\n    def apply_kv(self):\r\n        with KVCtx():\r\n            self.x @= self.y\r\n```\r\n\r\nand is right next to the setup.py file that contains \r\n```py\r\nfrom distutils.core import setup\r\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\r\nfrom os.path import join, dirname, abspath\r\n\r\nsetup(\r\n    ext_modules=cythonize(abspath(join(dirname(__file__), \"kv_cython_test.pyx\")))\r\n)\r\n```",
