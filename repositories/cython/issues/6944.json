Currently args to def functions using .pyx syntax can have the 'not None' and 'or None' qualifiers but args to cpdef and cdef functions cannot. Note that args defined with annotations end up having either the 'not None' or the 'or None' modifier.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nI believe removing the code that makes these modifiers a syntax error is most of what's needed.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
