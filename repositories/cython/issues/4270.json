Use the `cython-users` mailing list instead.\r\n- Did you search for similar issues already? Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release? It might already have what you want to report. Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to be possible to specify a memoryview size (i.e. `<double[:size:1]>`) using the pure-Python `cython.cast` syntax. This is normally used when interpreting a C/C++ array as a memoryview\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n```cython\r\n#distutils: language=c++\r\n\r\nimport cython\r\nfrom cython.cimports.libcpp.vector import vector\r\n\r\ndef func(n: cython.int):\r\n    vec = vector[cython.double](n)\r\n    \r\n    # two lines should be equivalent\r\n    memview: cython.double[::1] = <cython.double[:vec.size():1]>vec.data()\r\n    memview2: cython.double[::1] = cython.cast(cython.double[:vec.size():1], vec.data())\r\n```\r\n\r\nGives:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmemview2: cython.double[::1] = cython.cast(cython.double[:vec.size():1], vec.data())\r\n                                                                     ^\r\n<filename.pyx>: Axis specification only allowed in the 'step' slot.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThere should probably be a way to do this\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Python version: 3.8.10\r\n - Cython 3.0.0a8\r\n\r\n",
