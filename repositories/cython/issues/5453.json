I didn't remember that this was documented.

They are needed in order to show source code in tracebacks, for example.\n\nLet's ask the other way - is there an actual problem with \"__file__\" pointing to the binary?

And the advantage of Cython over PyPy or GraalPython is the runtime support to CPython.\r\n\r\nFor C/C++ or Rust, the language is just a method for producing shared-library, the users doesn't care about language (They only interest on the final produced shared library). Why it is OK to do like that for C/C++ or Rust? Because, they have their own ecosystem and market, being a language to develop Python extension module is just a be a negligible use case. But for Cython, the situation is different, Cython cannot exist without Python. If user want to do some system native project completely get rid of Python. This user certainly will not choose Cython. It will directly use Rust or C/C++ to finish the project.\r\n\r\nFor Cython, the focus should be targeting on the language itself and interoperability between Cython and Python runtime. For Cython currently it translate to C code, maybe in future to have a more performance gain, it directly translate to LLVM IR code. Or use lower overhead technique other than dynamic loading `*.so` files to keep executing faster. But All those doesn't change the Cython language and how end-user use it. The only difference which user can notice is execution speed.\r\n\r\nIf Cython want to get interest from new user and new project, beside legacy usage. The points I described above is notable. Otherwise, when Mojo (an AI-inspired general purpose programming language) (https://github.com/modularml/mojo) become open source to public. Cython will likely be \"deprecated\" (loss its advantage).
