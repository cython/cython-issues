As long as the generated C makes no references to the Python C API (or other external libraries outside of libc) it probably should work. I'm not sure it's possible to generate C functions that make no reference to the Python C API with Cython. Even if it is, the inability to use any Python objects will significantly limit what one can do with it.\r\n\r\nI imagine you would need something that converts Python code to C or C++ without requiring libpython/CPython in the end. Maybe pythran could do it, since it apparently has a [C++ run time](https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DEVGUIDE.html#c-runtime), not sure, but in general it's a somewhat orthogonal issue to building for web assembly.",
