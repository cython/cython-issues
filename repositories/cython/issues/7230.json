The solution was to use C++ mutexes, which is completely fine, but it lead me down a bit of a rabbit hole, since you need:\n```cython\nif lock.try_lock():\n    with nogil:\n        lock.lock()\ntry:\n    # actual code\nfinally:\n    lock.unlock()\n```\n\nWhich has two things that mildly annoying:\n1. It's easy to forget the `with nogil:` stepping stone.  Which is OK, in the sense that I could wrap those three lines into a single helper, but it's still a common mistake to make if the best solution is to use C++ mutexes.\n2. The try/finally just isn't pretty, especially for the use case where you need to lock down a whole function.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nNow in an ideal world, we could have some syntax like:\n```cython\nwith lock():\n    ...\n```\nand\n```\n@lock()\ndef func():\n    pass\n```\n\nI had discussed with @ngoldbaum about whether there are canonical solution for this to plan for free-threading and I don't think we knew anything better than C++ mutexes.\nUnfortunately, I think enabling that nicer syntax has to be a language feature to make it performant.\n\nTo note: I am coming from existing rlocks/C++ `recurisve_mutex` but I am happy if the precise use-case ends up not being solved!\n\n@ngoldbaum may have a clearer picture of what might be most helpful.  I could for example imagine that we can solve a lot of \"future problems\" with a language feature for critical sections (and for a decorator that might even just nice for `self`).\n(Although, it might still be good to make a small library with locking that is less error prone than C++ mutexes, even if it is just mildly wrapped up C++ mutexes.)\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nHoping to make things a bit cleaner lead me into the rabbit hole of writing some C++ code (inlined into the `.pyd`) to support something akin a C++ `scoped_lock`, which then allows:\n```cython\ndef function():\n    # lock for the whole function\n    cdef scoped_lock _lock = scoped_lock(self._mutex)\n```\nand also this, but you really want the try/finally if it is more than one statement:\n```\nlock(self._mutex)\n# one statement\nlock.unlock()\n```\n(That version, additionally allows `scoped_lock(mutex, DISABLE_GC)` because cupy has that and maybe even needs it -- I don't know the history yet.)",

On older versions of Python we provide a workable fallback based on `PyThread_lock_type` that has the same properties but probably a little slower. \n\nObviously that doesn't have all the flexible combinations that the C++ mutex types have though.\n\nIn the upcoming Cython 3.2 I've created `py_safe` functions for a lot of locking stuff. There's a few examples in https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/3ada45d1852699921f5a28da769a550aa15ae267/tests/run/cpp_mutex.pyx#L48 (search for `py_safe_`). These auto-handle the GIL so again may help with some of what you're after. \n\nI definitely see the appeal of a nice context manager type interface though. \n\n> `scoped_lock(mutex, DISABLE_GC)`\n\nI came to the conclusion that disabling the GC is an unsolvable multi-threading disaster. Essentially because anyone can re-enable it from any other thread. And you can never safely re-enable it because another thread might have also disabled it and be relying on that.\n\n------------\n\nWill look in more detail later and give a more thought through answer.",

I know it was added for a reason in cupy, but it did seem strange and something that would be nice to remove. But I had not realized how bad it is (I suppose it might work in simple enough functions if you hold the GIL, but then free-threading will be an issue anyway... reminds me of the attempt disastrous attempt to handle signals in NumPy).\n\nSorry, coming from recursive-mutex I had missed the [free-threading docs](https://docs.cython.org/en/stable/src/userguide/freethreading.html) explaining that you already have much of this for critical section and `pymutex`.\nThat may or may not help with what I have (I suspect the recurisve-mutex may not be needed, but I am not sure yet).
