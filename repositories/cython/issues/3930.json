    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently one can set directives by them in decorators, comments in files, adding them to `cythonize` in `setup.py`, or passing them to the CLI. While there is a lot of flexibility here, one thing that is missing is the ability to affect Cython directives via environment variables. This can be useful when a user is somewhat removed from the source code (like a package maintainer). Environment variables can be useful here as they can be picked up by `cython` even if one is running something else to perform the build (like `make` or `pip`). They also can be handy as it doesn't involve more invasive changes like patching the source, which can be trick in complex packages.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nFollowing convention it would be nice to have an environment variable like `CYTHONFLAGS` (analogous to `CFLAGS`). Cython could just check to see if that environment variable exists and add it to all calls. One question that comes up would be the order of these flags relative to any other flags Cython may include (namely whether to prepend or append them).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nOther solutions mentioned above involve patching. Though this can be pretty project specific and may be difficult to scale if this needed across multiple different builds.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nSome examples of this might be building multiple packages with profiling enabled, configuring different warnings, or affect what optimizations are applied. These can be things that may be useful for one package. Though for complex stacks, it is useful to definitively apply the same changes to multiple. Environment variables can be very handy for this task.",
