There are several situations where I need like 10 lines of C or C++ code to bridge something that Cython cannot quite do and thus have to add a separate file for. Would be wonderful to have single-source capability. Sad to see no response has been made here. One suggested way to do this is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef extern from _:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    C or C++ code goes here in this string. Gets included as if it had been in a header file (instead of using _ above).\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Then the normal extern definitions go here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is already a `cdef extern from *:` so `cdef extern from _:` shouldn't be so bad. However you do have to add the requirement for a string showing up as the first thing in the block. The string get copy-and-pasted into the generated source.",
