    "body": "This bug is closely related to ticket http://trac.cython.org/ticket/386, however it is slightly different in that it reports a realistic use case that in my opinion would qualify it as a bug rather than an enhancement request.  Hence I've raised a new ticket, but I'm new round here - maybe it should be merged.\n\nThe discovery of the bug stems from answering a question on Stack Overflow : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30054019/complex-numbers-in-cython.  It affects numpy multiplication of complex numbers by real valued floats\n\nIn its most concise form - this code produces C that will not compile:\n\n```\ncimport numpy as np\n\ncdef extern from \"complex.h\":\n    pass\n\ncdef:\n    np.complex128_t varc128 = 1j\n    np.float64_t varf64 = 1.\n\nvarc128 = varc128 * varf64\n```\n\nwhereas the same code produces error free C code with only order of multiplicands reversed. (i.e. substitute `varc128 = varf64 * varc128` for `varc128 = varc128 * varf64`.  This appears to be because there are different routes for achieving the multiplication depending on the order of operands, in the first (failing) example it is done via `__pyx_t_npy_float64_complex` types, whereas in the latter `__pyx_t_npy_double_complex`\n\nAs far as I could investigate - the offending line of generated C code fails to compile because only `float`, `double` or `long double` are allowed before `_Complex` (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html#Standard-Complex-Number-Types).  \n\nThe offending line of C code seems to be generated by the code here:\n\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/bb4d9c2de71b7c7e1e02d9dfeae53f4547fa9d7d/Cython/Compiler/PyrexTypes.py#L1949\n\nWe can see here that the offending type is basically an alias for `double`\n\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/e3f5343f3b648fc0033bdaf0def3268abab7b9ea/Cython/Includes/numpy/__init__.pxd#L331\n\nI haven't got a full, generalisable fix / patch as I'm totally new to the codebase, but ''possibly'' the code here should check whether it's valid to append the _Complex and, if not, search to see whether the type can be resolved to an allowable base type.\n\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/bb4d9c2de71b7c7e1e02d9dfeae53f4547fa9d7d/Cython/Compiler/Nodes.py#L1011\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/850\n",
