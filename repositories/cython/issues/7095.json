That involves accepting most of the same command-line arguments as MSVC and also being binary compatible with MSVC. Therefore is _should_ just work as an alternative Windows compiler for people that want to avoid MSVC.\n\nIt'd be good to test this a bit (while trying not to grow the number of different CI runs excessively). It is probably already available on the Windows machines so it may just be a case of changing the `CC` environment variable.\n\nIf it does work then I think we should also update our very outdated [appendix on Cython+mingw](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/appendix.html).",
