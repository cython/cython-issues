It's actually quite handy that you can just return from a finally block inside of a C callback and have it drop exceptions.\n\nBut that's from C. I understand that this leads to bugs in Python code (probably also in some Cython code), so the PEP is definitely a step forward. I'm just reluctant to remove this feature from Cython as well. I agree that we don't have to. And I didn't see any complains yet.",
