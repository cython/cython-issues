It'd be good to be able to use those where available, without too much code duplication. Cython currently only provides utility code that wraps `PyObject_VectorcallDict`, which is a worse choice where keyword arguments are involved since it involves creating an extra dict, and extracting the out.\r\n\r\nTherefore we should ideally also have utility code that wraps something close to the real vectorcall interface. It might be worth passing the keyword arguments as a C array rather than a tuple to avoid unnecessary tuple creation when the real vectorcall interface isn't available though (or having both options available).\r\n\r\nIt'd also be worth using these in our regular code-generation for `GeneralCallNode` when known keyword arguments are involved. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom xxx import f\r\n\r\ndef call_f(a, b, c):\r\n    f(a, b, c=c, d=\"d\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nstill uses the call protocol rather than the vectorcall protocol.\r\n\r\nSo don't this helps both utility code and regular code generation.",
