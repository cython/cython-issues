Also see the [Changelog](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst) regarding recent changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nAs was found in #3829 - CPython currently supports using a custom mapping implementation for the `__annotations__` object. This is not explicitly stated in the [runtime effects of PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/#runtime-effects-of-type-annotations), but there is an explicit test for it in `test_grammar`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/tests/run/test_grammar.py#L491-L498\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAs of #3829, we support the `__annotations__` mapping on class scopes, but do so by creating the entry after we've analysed the rest of the class body and gathered annotations.\r\n\r\nIn order to support custom mappings for the `__annotations__` namespace, and also support other side-effects of eager-declaration, such as `del __annotations__`, we should declare the `__annotations__` entry in the scope once the first annotation in the body is encountered, then update the entry as new annotations are encountered.\r\n\r\nThis will also completely fulfill the requirement that the `__annotations__` dict is [mutable at runtime](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/#runtime-effects-of-type-annotations). As it is currently implemented, the `__annotations__` dict is only mutable/delete-able *after* we construct the class.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from the test in `test_grammar`, there is also additional behavior that should be supported:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n\r\nclass C:\r\n    var: int\r\n    del __annotations__\r\n\r\nC.__annotations__\r\n#> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n#>   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n#> AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute '__annotations__'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n\r\nclass D:\r\n    a: int\r\n    __annotations__['b'] = 'str'\r\n\r\nprint(D.__annotations__)\r\n#> {'a': 'int', 'b': 'str'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cython\r\n\r\nclass E:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nE.__annotations__\r\n#> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n#>   File \"<input>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n#> AttributeError: type object 'E' has no attribute '__annotations__'\r\n```\r\n",
