Once Cython 3.0 is released, NumPy can upgrade immediately to the version with the `@property` decorator. \r\n\r\nI am not sure what the backward support story is for Cython + NumPy. According to [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html), July 2021 is the earliest possible date for deprecating 1.17, but we are still getting reports of people building older, supposedly deprecated NumPy versions. It is tricky to retroactively limit the highest version of Cython used to build NumPy (although the sdist package does not require Cython).",

The only difference between the two versions (Cython/NumPy) that I'm aware of is that the properties in Cython are read-only, whereas the struct fields are writable. The rest should be the same now (AFAICT).\r\n\r\n@mattip, do you see anything else that we could do?",
