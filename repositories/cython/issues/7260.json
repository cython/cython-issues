In such a case, and with perennial sleep depravation ( tell me if I am wrong ) and soapy eye, adding this little feature can be a difference of a long chase for ghosts. So, in case I am not plain wrong in understanding the code, and if this makes sense, it would be nice to add that `break;` just in case it helps someone down the road.",

That's because there is not necessarily a switch statement at all, in the case that there is _only_ the `default` case (and that's the intention of the PR). I did a bit of research if a `switch` statement can have no `case:` but only `default:`, which is apparently allowed but not explicitly spelled out in the C spec and the compiler documentations that I found (it's certainly a rare thing to want outside of generated code, and the wording is more like \"you can have an arbitrary number of 'case' statements\"). So I decided that I didn't want to generate such code and discarded the `switch` statement all together in that case. And it turned out that that's easier to generate without a final `break;` because that would have to be guarded by a separate condition.\n\nThus, no final `break;`. I find it more important that the code generation is readable than the generated code, if that's the tradeoff.",
