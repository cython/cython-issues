            "body": "Some more details: Python's pickle module needs to be able to find the code of the function somehow. In the case of a Python function, that can be done by pickling the code object that contains the Python byte code. In the case of a compiled (binary/native) function, there is no byte code, and pickling native code isn't very useful/portable/easy. Thus, for native functions, the pickle module would want to pickle the state of the function and the import path to find the function. Locally defined (nested) functions cannot be imported, so pickle will not be able to unpickle their state.\r\n\r\nThat being said, in some cases, it might be possible to register a global function in the module as entry point for unpickling Cython compiled functions. But that's a) probably quite some work and b) only applicable to functions for which the entire state can be pickled, i.e. no pointer variables or C++ objects locally or in any of the outer closures. Platform specific data types also play a role here. It would be a challenge to pickle a C long value on a platform with 64bits and unpickling it on a platform with 32bit long integers, for example.",
