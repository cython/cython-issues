I think some users might appreciate it if we could get a Cython release out then that supports it as well as Python 2.7, so that they could continue to use that release as long as they feel like it. But I would personally not mind having 0.29 be the last Py2 compatible release, or 3.0. It's not like what's been released will magically start failing on January 1st next year. And I probably wouldn't object to making a bug fix release for that last Py2 release series if someone backports a fix that we make in a future version.\r\n\r\nI think the main question is really: should we still add Py3.8 to the current list of supported Py2+ versions or not.\r\n\r\nI don't see a future Cython release support Python 3.9+ and still carry around Py2.7 cruft.",

At that moment, Python 2.6 and 3.3 support was removed.\r\n\r\nSo would it be time to consider dropping Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 already before the 3.0 release? I have no idea how far away it is, but the list of features missing out on is growing, the testing and CI matrices for minor version support keep growing and the percentage of users still using those versions is getting smaller.\r\n\r\nOf course the 0.29.x release series can keep support. I think the intersection of users still using Python 2.7, 3.4 or 3.5 _and_ benefiting from the latest improvements of Cython 3.0 is quite small.",

That's the main feature of that future release.\r\n\r\nThat plan hasn't changed for a long time, and it doesn't look like it will. Still, I understand the sentiment (of @EwoutH), not least because that plan was made when Cython 3 was still scheduled for 2019 - three years later, I think reality has overtaken the utility of keeping Python 2.7 support in Cython 3; with every passing month it is more and more just dead weight for an (almost) empty set of users.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there are only 1-2 remaining blockers (with PRs +/- ready to be merged) for 3.0, so if an end is in sight, then of course it's better just to push it over the finish line as-is.\r\n\r\nSidenote: with adding CI for 3.12 alpha, Cython will support 10(!) separate python versions released over a span of ~15 years - a monumental feat. 🤯",

Even 3.5 does not seem entirely negligible to me, even though it's probably small enough to let users stick with Cython < 3.0.\r\n\r\nI think it's reasonable to keep support for Python 2.7 and 3.5+ in Cython 3.0, and remove everything below Py3.6 in Cython 3.1. But I'm open to also drop Py3.5 support in Cython 3.0, if there's somewhat of a reason. (Sorry for the edits.)",

It's a way more modern version than 2.7. So I would suggest keeping this discussion about dropping 3.5 and lower, which means dropping 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5. Moving to Python 3 allows to drop a large amount of redundant code, and 3.4 and 3.5 are not used that much. Also, Python 3.6 is the lowest version [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel) supports.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to the following point again:\r\n\r\n> Of course the 0.29.x release series can keep support. I think the intersection of users still using Python 2.7, 3.4 or 3.5 and benefiting from the latest improvements of Cython 3.0 is quite small.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that _intersection_ of users on very old Python versions like 2.7 expecting and using new cython features is very small. There is a very good case to be made for keeping legency support and bugfixes for such a important project as cython, but that's where the 0.29.x maintenance branch is for.\r\n\r\nThe second question is how close is the 3.0 release? If it's withing a few months, keeping 2.7 in for a tad longer doesn't have that much costs, but if it's more than 6 months away I would say let's drop it now to allow reduced testing, CI and maintenance efforts to speed up development.",
