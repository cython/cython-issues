I think some users might appreciate it if we could get a Cython release out then that supports it as well as Python 2.7, so that they could continue to use that release as long as they feel like it. But I would personally not mind having 0.29 be the last Py2 compatible release, or 3.0. It's not like what's been released will magically start failing on January 1st next year. And I probably wouldn't object to making a bug fix release for that last Py2 release series if someone backports a fix that we make in a future version.\r\n\r\nI think the main question is really: should we still add Py3.8 to the current list of supported Py2+ versions or not.\r\n\r\nI don't see a future Cython release support Python 3.9+ and still carry around Py2.7 cruft.",
