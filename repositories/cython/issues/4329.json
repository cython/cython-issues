Recently I was able to refactor the code a bit and now (version 3.8 and up) Stackless uses the same structure as C-Python. Therefore it is no longer necessary to compute the offset of field `f_localsplus` at runtime.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/blob/3a0ca192ed497f81c7bee60f13f635c9ac265e72/Cython/Utility/ObjectHandling.c#L2449-L2458\r\n\r\nOf course this code still works and is still required for Stackless versions prior to 3.8.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n  Anselm\r\n",
