    "body": "Honestly, I have spent countless hours trying to figure this out.\r\n\r\nBasically, I am developing a serialization framework that uses Cython to compile code. I wanted to compose a demo console app that would benchmark it against other frameworks.\r\n\r\nSince my app compiles the code on-demand at runtime, it prints all the GCC warning to the console. \r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\n/Users/matejmicek/Library/Caches/cython/inline/_cython_inline_699ae8778e7c6b1e514d6416245faebf.c:3737:13: warning: unused variable\r\n      '__pyx_doc_4read_16read_fixed' [-Wunused-variable]\r\nstatic char __pyx_doc_4read_16read_fixed[] = \"Fixed instances are encoded using the number of bytes declared in the\\n\\tschema.\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, it is technically really difficult to get rid of the causes of these warnings. Meaning I have support files that sometimes contain unnecessary stuff for one schema but necessary for another.\r\n\r\nMy question is: How do I get rid of these?\r\n\r\nWhen trying to get rid of these warning I tried:\r\n- googling: didn't help\r\n- passing compiler directives to Cython: I set all the 'warn' ones to False but this did not change anything.\r\n- redirecting `stdout` and `stderr` to `/dev/null`: this surprisingly didn't help either. This I honestly can't understand. The problem with these warnings is that they apparently dont print to either `stdout` or `stderr`, which from my understanding of Unix is not possible, but apparently I am wrong in this case.\r\n- looking through the code of Cython and trying to silence it there, but it all comes down to the compiler I think.\r\n\r\nWhat I want: I want a real cythonice `silent` option that blocks ALL the logs/prints out of the stream. \r\n\r\nMaybe it is already possible and if so, please let me know how.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot to everyone!\r\n\r\nMatej\r\n\r\n\r\n",
