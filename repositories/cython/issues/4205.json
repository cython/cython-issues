Please do, it helps to save us precious time that we otherwise could not invest into development.\r\n- Did you try the latest master branch or pre-release?

The test-suite passed here, so all is well. However I also got an email telling me that https://github.com/da-woods/cython/actions/runs/892232889 had failed (because of an older PyPy testing bug that's been fixed on master).\r\n\r\nSo what seems to have happened is that github actions has run on both the raw commit I submitted, and the PR where the commit is merged with master. This seems unnecessary.",
