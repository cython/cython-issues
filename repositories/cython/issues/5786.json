Mailing lists are too old and inconvenient for technical discussions where you often want to share styled code snippets or embed span of the source code inline. GitHub Discusses is relatively more accessible and easy to use for many of us. Please consider it.\r\n\r\nDiscourse would also be very appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
