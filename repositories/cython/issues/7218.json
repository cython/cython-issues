While this version may\nwork perfectly fine, it is possible that you may experience issues.\nPlease downgrade to a supported version, or update cython_max in\nsetup.cfg to your version of Cython. It is best to use the newest\nsupported version, 0.29.33, but the minimum supported version is 0.24.\n\nIf your platform provides a Cython package, check if you can downgrade\nto a supported version. Otherwise, uninstall the platform package and\ninstall Cython via pip:\n\n    pip install -I \"cython>=0.24,<=0.29.33,!=0.27,!=0.27.2\"\n\nPlease note that the following versions of Cython are not supported\nat all: 0.27, 0.27.2\n\nUsing this graphics system: OpenGL ES 2\nWARNING: A problem occurred while running pkg-config --libs --cflags sdl2 SDL2_ttf SDL2_image SDL2_mixer (code 1)\n\nb\"Package sdl2 was not found in the pkg-config search path.\\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `sdl2.pc'\\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\\nNo package 'sdl2' found\\nPackage SDL2_ttf was not found in the pkg-config search path.\\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `SDL2_ttf.pc'\\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\\nNo package 'SDL2_ttf' found\\nPackage SDL2_image was not found in the pkg-config search path.\\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `SDL2_image.pc'\\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\\nNo package 'SDL2_image' found\\nPackage SDL2_mixer was not found in the pkg-config search path.\\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `SDL2_mixer.pc'\\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\\nNo package 'SDL2_mixer' found\\n\"\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\n# example code\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe App should find the correct specified python and use it to build kivy and when downgrading the version to <0.29.33 still fails\n\n### OS\n\nwindows\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.9\n\n### Cython version\n\n0.29.33\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The first advises you what versions of Cython that version of Kivy is tested with.\n2. The second tells you that you haven't got SDL (which is apparently one of the dependencies of Kivy).\n\nThe second message is you main issue and is **nothing to do with Cython**. I suggest you ask on the Kivy support channel.",
