We just don't normally do it because it's cumbersome to copy all the boiler plate code together and write refnanny code by hand. If it helps here, it might be worth using. (My guess is that there are quite a number of utility code functions that might benefit from this, especially in `ObjectHandling.c` and `Builtins.c`, which deal a lot with object references.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @scoder in https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/5219#discussion_r1083833159_\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that it's gonna be nice to simplify initialisation and use of refnanny so it could be used i utility code as well",
