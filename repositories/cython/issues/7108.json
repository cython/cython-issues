    "body": "### Describe the bug\n\nI've been exploring the limited API support (great so far!), and some packages (mpi4py, petsc4py) use a pattern like:\n\n```cython\nctypedef api class TestClass [\n    type   Test_Type,\n    object TestObject,\n]:\n    cdef int attr\n```\n\nwhich emits a generated `_api.h` header. When this header is included (indirectly from their package header) to use the package's C API in downstream packages that _are not themselves Cython_, but the limited API is used, compilation fails with errors like:\n\n```\n│ │   In file included from $PREFIX/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mpi4py/include/mpi4py/mpi4py.h:26:\n │ │   $PREFIX/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mpi4py/include/mpi4py/../../MPI_api.h:191:40: error: member access into incomplete type 'PyTypeObject' (aka '_typeobject')\n │ │     191 |     itemsize = ((PyTypeObject *)result)->tp_itemsize;\n │ │         |                                        ^\n │ │   $PREFIX/include/python3.12/pytypedefs.h:20:16: note: forward declaration of '_typeobject'\n │ │      20 | typedef struct _typeobject PyTypeObject;\n```\n\nLooking into the code, it appears to be because the internal `CYTHON_COMPILING_IN_LIMITED_API` is not defined when `Py_LIMITED_API` is defined.\n\n\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\nctypedef api class TestClass [\n    type   Test_Type,\n    object TestObject,\n]:\n    cdef int attr\n```\n\nwhich produces the relevant code:\n\n```c\n#if !CYTHON_COMPILING_IN_LIMITED_API\n    basicsize = ((PyTypeObject *)result)->tp_basicsize;\n    itemsize = ((PyTypeObject *)result)->tp_itemsize;\n#else\n```\n\nbut the limited API branch is _not_ taken when this header is included and `Py_LIMITED_API` is defined.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nlimited api branch in generated `_api.h` is taken when Py_LIMITED_API is defined, without requiring what appears to be cython-internal `-DCYTHON_COMPILING_IN_LIMITED_API=1`.\n\n### OS\n\nmacOS, linux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.12.9\n\n### Cython version\n\n3.1.3\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm guessing that some subset of the macro definitions in the top of a regular Cython .c file should also be in the `_api.h`? Or maybe these checks should be directly for `Py_LIMITED_API`? Or maybe packages should be doing something different in exposing these headers to make sure the right things are defined when included from a non-Cython .c file? I haven't been able to find much documentation of how `cdef api` is supposed to be used to produce a C API for a Cython library like mpi4py/petsc4py.",
