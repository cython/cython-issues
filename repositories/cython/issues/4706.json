Given this wonder if it makes sense to start using these in Cython as well. Perhaps with a fallback for earlier Python versions (maybe using macros).\r\n\r\nref: https://bugs.python.org/issue43753",

However, replacing the usage code `... is None` etc. is a bit more work since `is` operator and `None` constant value are two different syntax nodes. I guess the `is` operator could just special case these.\r\n\r\nPR welcome.",
