Fixed in https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4265\r\n- [x] `run/cpp_stl_string` - iteration? #4265\r\n- [x] `compile/cpp_temp_assignment` - closures #4265\r\n- [ ] `run/fused_cpp` - not sure but it involves typeid so probably just needs special-casing\r\n- [x] `run/if_else_expr_cpp` - to  do with fakereferences #4265\r\n- [ ] `errors/w_uninitialized_cpp` - typeid again\r\n",
