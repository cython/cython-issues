This doesn't work (i.e. it's unable to correctly work out the type)\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\n```cython\r\nfrom cython cimport int as cy_i\r\ncimport cython\r\n\r\ndef f(a: cython.int, b: cy_i):\r\n    print(cython.typeof(a), cython.typeof(b))\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe types of `a` and `b` should both be C `int`. In reality `a` is C `int` and `b` is a PyObject.\n\n### Environment\n\nOS:  Linux\r\nPython version 3.10.9\r\nCython version current master\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
