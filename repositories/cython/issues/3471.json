Using normal Python syntax and idioms in Cython code helps avoiding human mistakes (like the one that lead to this ticket), keeps the code easier to read and more maintainable, and allows Cython to generate _more_ efficient code in many cases. It's really a win-win-win approach.\r\n\r\nOnly hand-tune your code if you really know and can prove in actual numbers that it's worth the added complexity. That applies to Cython in the same way as Python.\r\n\r\nAnd, if you ever find a situation where you can write better C code than what Cython generates, consider improving Cython, so that all Cython users can benefit from it.",
