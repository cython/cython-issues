In case of doubt, increment it, rather than inventing new patterns (i.e. adding new components to the version string).\n\n[^1]: yes, it's fixable; but then I need to undo the fix again once the `-1` gets dropped, or build ugly logic that accounts for both possibilities. Which works until someone uses `.post1` or some other thing. This kind of churn is souldestroyingly pointless.\n",

            "body": "I think this question is not so much about versioning but about what constitutes a release. From what you write, you seem to consider the git tag the release. And sure, there is a git tag that corresponds to the release. But the release is what appears on PyPI, with the version that PyPI and the uploaded files report.\n\nIn this case (and in a few cases before), the git tag is not the same as the version but counted up a bit. The last `-x` tag is definitely the final release that goes to PyPI. I used that before in case of (sometimes partial) build failures that hindered a release, in order to avoid moving the published tag in the public git repo. But this is the first time that I allowed functional changes in before the final `-x` release.\n\nI gather from your request that this approach is a problem for you. I could use a four digit version instead to count up the release, so that the released version number on PyPI corresponds directly to the tag name in git. If you intend to continue pulling changes from git rather than PyPI, then that would probably help with the automation.",

I could use a four digit version instead to count up the release, so that the released version number on PyPI corresponds directly to the tag name in git.\n\nI can switch to PyPI sources if that's your preferred way. As long as there's only one PyPI release regardless of how high `-x` goes, that'd be fine. FWIW, I had [switched](https://github.com/conda-forge/cython-feedstock/commit/a8bd4edcd7ad0e6d196d8b1c764fae47d51161e7) to tags because they're much more convenient when it's necessary to carry patches etc. (and it's one less worry about what transformations happen between the tag and the tarball).\n\n> But this is the first time that I allowed functional changes in before the final `-x` release.\n\nIf there had been no functional change between 3.2.3 and 3.2.3-1, I would have just ignored this. But now it seems like I need to pick this up to not expose users to a bug (or at least potential performance regression).\n\nThat's why my initial point was to simply name this 3.2.4. The patch version has gone up until [37](https://github.com/cython/cython/releases/tag/0.29.37)[^1] before already, which (v)indicates that it really doesn't matter how high that number goes. If 3.2.3 ends up getting skipped in the process -- would any user care?\n\nThat said, a four-part version number in such a situation (though I'm really not a fan) would at least be better than the hyphen.\n\n[^1]: which ironically had a similar [fixup](https://github.com/cython/cython/releases/tag/0.29.37.1) but not the same version pattern.",
