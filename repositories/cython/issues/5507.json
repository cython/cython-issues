Please describe.\r\n\r\nWe've discussed speeding up memoryview slicing before, because it isn't as quick as we've like it to be.\r\n\r\nConsider a common case:\r\n```cython\r\ndef f(double[:,:] x):\r\n    for i in range(x.shape[0]):\r\n        y = x[i, :]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the past we've discussed making `y` effectively a \"borrowed\" reference until we're outside the loop.\r\n\r\nHowever - I possibly have a simpler solution. The c code generated looks something like\r\n\r\n```c\r\n    __pyx_t_4.data = __pyx_v_x.data;\r\n    __pyx_t_4.memview = __pyx_v_x.memview;\r\n    __PYX_INC_MEMVIEW(&__pyx_t_4, 1);\r\n    {\r\n    Py_ssize_t __pyx_tmp_idx = __pyx_v_i;\r\n\r\n    /* validation of shape emitted for brevity */\r\n        __pyx_t_4.data += __pyx_tmp_idx * __pyx_tmp_stride;\r\n}\r\n\r\n__pyx_t_4.shape[0] = __pyx_v_x.shape[1];\r\n__pyx_t_4.strides[0] = __pyx_v_x.strides[1];\r\n    __pyx_t_4.suboffsets[0] = -1;\r\n\r\n__PYX_XCLEAR_MEMVIEW(&__pyx_v_y, 1);\r\n    __pyx_v_y = __pyx_t_4;\r\n    __pyx_t_4.memview = NULL;\r\n    __pyx_t_4.data = NULL;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nThe main point to note is that the reference counting (`__PYX_INC_MEMVIEW` and `__PYX_XCLEAR_MEMVIEW`) is unnecessary. In the most common case, `x` and `y` will both be viewing the same object, so we should optimize for that case and skip the reference counting if possible. (Obviously we want to leave it they refer to different objects).\r\n\r\nIt's a bit fiddly from a code-generation point of view, but I think it's an easy win if it can be made to work.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nThe \"borrowed reference until we leave the loop\" approach.\r\n\r\nNote that this version does ultimately still involve a borrowed reference, but with much more limited scope that can probably be special-cased.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nAssigned this to myself since I plan to look at it in the next month or so.",
