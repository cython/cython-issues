Additionally, any time a link is traversed, a cloudflare check pops up. This seems excessive for a static site.\n\n### Code to reproduce the behaviour:\n\nhttps://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/overview.html\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nDocs are restored to as before without using cloudflare.\n\n### OS\n\nAll\n\n### Python version\n\nN/A\n\n### Cython version\n\nN/A\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The article from readthedocs implies that they're using cloudflare to block some of that load. \n\nI suspect you're getting caught up in that.\n\nUnfortunately this is also a good reason for us to host it on readthedocs because they have the time and resources to try to block it, while if it was self-hosted then it'd just be down. \n\nSo that's my theory anyway.",
