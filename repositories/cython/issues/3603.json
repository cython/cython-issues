    "body": "After some debugging, we found out that `__Pyx_PyType_Ready` can garble arbitrary memory.\r\nIndeed, it has the following lines:\r\n```c++\r\n#if PY_VERSION_HEX >= 0x03050000\r\n    t->tp_flags |= Py_TPFLAGS_HEAPTYPE;\r\n#endif\r\n    r = PyType_Ready(t);\r\n#if PY_VERSION_HEX >= 0x03050000\r\n    t->tp_flags &= ~Py_TPFLAGS_HEAPTYPE;\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is if `PyType_Ready` indirectly triggers the garbage collector. The static type `t` will be incorrectly considered as a heap type, and therefore as a GC-enabled object. When traversing this object, the GC will lookup the GC header by subtracting 16 bytes from `t`'s beginning, which may point to any other C static variable. Then it will temporarily \"decref\" the GC header, modifying other data.\r\n(in our case, that other data is a Cython function's `ml_flags`, rendering it unusable, but that might be something else, depending what your Cython module contains)\r\n",

That'll be ripped out in Cython 3.1, shortly after the 3.0 release. But we could already start by switching to heap types for Py3.4+ in Cython 3.0. (No, this will not change in 0.29.x any more.)\r\n\r\n~~We could also mitigate the issue by only setting the heaptype flag if there actually are heap types involved, I think. That could also be done in 0.29.x.~~\r\nEdit: turns out, this code is really only run if there _are_ heap type bases.",
