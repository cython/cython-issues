For example, checking both lineno and col_offset for every node might be excessive if the primary goal is to verify the structure of the AST. Consider simplifying the tests to focus on the most critical aspects.\n**BinOp Assertions:** \nIn the sections where you check the properties of binary operations (e.g., ast.BinOp), you are asserting both lineno and col_offset for each part of the binary operation. For example:\n\n**self.assertEqual(binop.lineno, 3)\nself.assertEqual(binop.left.lineno, 3)\nself.assertEqual(binop.right.lineno, 3)\nself.assertEqual(binop.col_offset, 3)\nself.assertEqual(binop.left.col_offset, 3)\nself.assertEqual(binop.right.col_offset, 7)**\n",
