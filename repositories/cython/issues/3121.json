    "body": "It is quite convenient to use `pyximport.install()` for adding tests of Cython's cdef-functionality to the usual testing-infrastructure.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pyx-modules aren't rebuild when only dependencies are changed but not the main-pyx-file. \r\n\r\nThere are remedies, but none of them as simple/clear as an explicit `force_rebuild`-argument would be. For example:\r\n    - using pyxdep-files which have the tendency not to get updated\r\n    - `pyximport.install(setup_args = {\"script_args\" : [\"--force\"]})` (not directly clear it can be achieved this way)\r\n    - deleting the cache (needs some tinkering with testing infrastructure)\r\n    - using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for `build_dir` -argument\r\n\r\nThere is already `force_rebuild`-argument in [`pyxbuild.pyx_to_dll`](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.29.x/pyximport/pyxbuild.py#L23).",
