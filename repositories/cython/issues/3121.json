For example:\r\n    - using pyxdep-files which have the tendency not to get updated\r\n    - `pyximport.install(setup_args = {\"script_args\" : [\"--force\"]})` (not directly clear it can be achieved this way)\r\n    - deleting the cache (needs some tinkering with testing infrastructure)\r\n    - using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for `build_dir` -argument\r\n\r\nThere is already `force_rebuild`-argument in [`pyxbuild.pyx_to_dll`](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.29.x/pyximport/pyxbuild.py#L23).",

Currently `pyximport` builds on `old_build_ext`: https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/3de7a4b8fb7ce045222e13ca02541f6a70e89c2e/pyximport/pyxbuild.py#L13\r\n\r\nif we switch it to `new_build_ext`, or to just `from Cython.Distutils import build_ext` and switch that build_ext to new implementation that is based on cythonize (#3541), then it will automatically fix pyximport to track build dependencies properly.",
